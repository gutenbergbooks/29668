<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE SHEEP COUNTRY</h3>
</div>
<p>So John Mackenzie had put his foot upon the road.
This after he had reasoned it out as a mathematical
problem, considering it as a matter of quantities
alone. There was nothing in school-teaching at sixty
dollars a month when men who had to carry a rubber
stamp to sign their names to their checks were making
fortunes all around him in sheep.</p>
<p>That was the way it looked to John Mackenzie the
morning he set out for Poison Creek to hunt up Tim
Sullivan and strike him for a job. Against the conventions
of the country, he had struck out on foot. That
also had been reasoned out in a cool and calculative way.
A sheepherder had no use for a horse, in the first place.
Secondly and finally, the money a horse would represent
would buy at least twelve head of ewes. With questioning
eyes upon him when he left Jasper, and contemptuous
eyes upon him when he met riders in his dusty
journey, John Mackenzie had pushed on, his pack on
his back.</p>
<p>There was not a book in that pack. John Mackenzie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
schoolmaster, had been a bondslave of books in that
country for four obscure, well-nigh profitless years,
and he was done with them for a while. The less a
sheepman knew about books, the more he was bound to
know about sheep, for sheep would be the object and
aim of his existence. Mackenzie knew plenty of sheepmen
who never had looked into any kind of a book but
a bank-deposit book in their lives. That seemed to be
education enough to carry them very nicely along, even
to boost them to the state legislature, and lift one of
them to the United States senate. So, what was the use
of worrying along on a mission of enlightenment at
sixty dollars a month?</p>
<p>Mackenzie had not come into the West in a missionary
spirit at the beginning. He had not believed
the youth of that section to be in any greater depths
of ignorance than elsewhere in this more or less favored
land. But from his earliest years he had entertained
romantic notions, adventurous desires. With his normal-school
certificate in his breast pocket, tight trousers
on his rather long legs, a short vest scarcely meeting
them at the waistband, he had traveled into the West,
seeking romance, alert for adventure.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Jasper, which was only the inter-mountain
West, and far from the golden coast of his
most fervid dreams, he found that adventure and
romance apparently had packed up and gone elsewhere
years ahead of him. There was nothing nearer either
of them in Jasper than a tame gambling-joint in the
back end of a saloon, where greasy, morose sheepherders
came to stake quarters on roulette and faro, where railroaders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
squandered away their wages, leaving the
grocerymen unpaid. And there was no romance for
John Mackenzie in any such proceeding as that.</p>
<p>Simple, you will see he was; open-faced and guileless
as the day. Farm-bred, raw-boned, slow of speech,
clear of eye, no vices, no habits that pulled a man down,
unless a fondness for his briar-root pipe might be so
classed. But in the way Mackenzie smoked the pipe it
was more in the nature of a sacrifice to his gods of
romance than even a mild dissipation.</p>
<p>In the four years of his school-teaching at Jasper
Mackenzie slowly grew out of his extreme rawness of
appearance. His legs hardened from long rambles over
the hills, his face browned like an outdoor man&#8217;s, his
rustic appearance, his clabber-days shyness, all slowly
dissolved away. But the school board was not cognizant
of any physical or mental strengthening in him. He
was worth sixty dollars a month to that slow-thinking
body when he came to Jasper; he was worth no more
than sixty dollars when he threw up the job and left.</p>
<p>Romance and adventure had called him away to the
road at last, but the romance of sheep-riches, the adventure
of following a flock over the sage-gray hills. Maybe
he would find it too late even to glimpse them when he
arrived in the heart of the sheeplands; perhaps times
had shifted since the heavy-jowled illiterates whom he
had met in Jasper began their careers with a few pounds
of dried apples and uncommon endurance for hardships
in the open fields.</p>
<p>Simple, they thought him down in Jasper, in the mild
simplicity of a preacher or any man who would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
fight. In their classification he was a neutral force, an
emasculated, mild, harmless creature who held the child&#8217;s
view of life from much association with children. He
often had heard it said.</p>
<p>A man never could advance to notability in a community
that rated him as mildly simple; he would have
a hard time of it even to become notorious. Only one
man there had taken an interest in him as man to man,
a flockmaster who had come into that country twenty
years before, a schoolteacher like himself.</p>
<p>This man had kicked up the golden dust before Mackenzie&#8217;s
eyes with his tales of the romance of the range,
the romance of sheep-riches, the quick multiplication of
a band run on the increase-sharing plan. This man
urged Mackenzie to join him, taking a band of sheep on
shares. But his range was in sight of Jasper; there was
no romance on his hills. So Mackenzie struck out for
the headwaters of Poison Creek, to find Tim Sullivan,
notable man among the sheep-rich of his day.</p>
<p>It was a five-days&#8217; journey on foot, as he calculated
it&ndash;&ndash;nobody in that country ever had walked it, as far
as he could learn&ndash;&ndash;to Tim Sullivan&#8217;s ranch on Poison
Creek. Now, in the decline of the fifth day he had come
to Poison Creek, a loud, a rapid, and boisterous stream
which a man could cross in two jumps. It made a great
amount of noise in its going over the boulders in its
bed, as a little water in a vast arid land probably was
justified by its importance in doing. It was the first
running water Mackenzie had met since leaving the Big
Wind, clear as if it came unpolluted by a hoof or a
hand from its mountain source.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>But somewhere along its course Tim Sullivan grazed
and watered forty thousand sheep; and beyond him
were others who grazed and watered many times that
number. Poison Creek might well enough merit its
name from the slaver of many flocks, the schoolmaster
thought, although he knew it came from pioneer days,
and was as obscure as pioneer names usually are obscure.</p>
<p>And some day he would be watering his thousands of
sheep along its rushing vein. That was John Mackenzie&#8217;s
intent and purpose as he trudged the dusty miles
of gray hills, with their furze of gray sage, and their
gray twilights which fell with a melancholy silence as
chilling as the breath of death. For John Mackenzie
was going into the sheeplands to become a master. He
had determined it all by mathematical rule.</p>
<p>There was the experience to be gained first, and it
was cheaper to do that at another man&#8217;s expense than
his own. He knew how the right kind of a man could
form a partnership with a flockmaster sometimes; he
had heard stories of such small beginnings leading to
large ownership and oily prosperity. Jasper had
examples of its own; he was familiar with them all.</p>
<p>Some of them began as herders on the basis of half
the increase from a stated number of sheep not more
than ten years past. Now they looked upon a sixty-dollars-a-month
schoolteacher with the eyes of superiority,
as money always despises brains which it is
obliged to hire, probably because brains cannot devise
any better method of finding the necessary calories than
that of letting themselves out by the month.</p>
<p>Tim Sullivan needed herders; he had advertised for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
them in the Jasper paper. Besides, Tim had the name
of a man who could see the possibilities in another. He
had put more than one young fellow on the way of success
in the twenty years he had been running sheep on
the Poison Creek range. But failing to land a partnership
deal with Sullivan, Mackenzie was prepared to take
a job running sheep by the month. Or, should he find
all avenues to experience at another man&#8217;s expense closed
to him, he was ready to take the six hundred dollars
saved out of his years of book bondage and buy a little
flock of his own. Somewhere in that wide expanse of
government-owned land he would find water and grazing,
and there his prosperity would increase.</p>
<p>Sheep had visited the creek lately at the point where
Mackenzie first encountered it, but there were no dusty
flocks in sight billowing over the hills. Tim Sullivan&#8217;s
house was not to be seen any more than sheep, from the
highest hill in the vicinity. It must be several miles
ahead of him still, Mackenzie concluded, remembering
that Poison Creek was long. Yet he hoped he might
reach it by nightfall, for his feet were growing weary of
the untrodden way they had borne him for a hundred
and fifty miles, more or less.</p>
<p>He pushed on, now and again crossing the broad trail
left by bands of sheep counting two or three thousand,
feeling the lonesomeness of the unpeopled land softened
by these domestic signs. Sunset, and no sight of a
house; nightfall, and not the gleam of a light to show
him either herder&#8217;s camp or permanent domicile of man.</p>
<p>Mackenzie lingered beside the clamoring water in a
little valley where the uncropped grass was lush about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
his feet, considering making camp there for the night.
It was a pleasant place for a land so bleak, even in summer,
as that country of high table-lands and rolling
gray hills. As he started to unsling his pack he caught
the dim note of somebody&#8217;s voice raised in song, and
stood so, hand on the strap, listening.</p>
<p>The voice was faint, broken by the distance, yet cheering
because it was a voice. Mackenzie pressed up the
hill, hoping to be able to thread the voice back to its
source from that eminence. As he neared the top the
voice came clearer; as he paused to listen, it seemed
quite close at hand. It was a woman singing, and this
was the manner of her song:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Na-a-fer a-lo-o-one, na-a-fer a-lone,<br />
He promise na-fer to leafe me,<br />
Na-fer to leafe me a-lone!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The valley whence came the song was quite dark
below him, and darker for the indefinite blotch of something
that appeared to be trees. In that grove the
house that sheltered the melancholy singer must be hidden,
so completely shrouded that not even a gleam of
light escaped to lead him to the door. Mackenzie stood
listening. There was no other sound rising from that
sequestered homestead than the woman&#8217;s song, and this
was as doleful as any sound that ever issued from human
lips.</p>
<p>Over and over again the woman sang the three lines,
a silence after the last long, tremulous note which
reached to the traveler&#8217;s heart, more eloquent in its
expression of poignant loneliness than the hopeless repetition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
of the song. He grinned dustily as he found himself
wishing, in all seriousness, that somebody would take
a day off and teach her the rest of the hymn.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s bones were weary of the road, hard as he
tried to make himself believe they were not, and that
he was a tough man, ready to take and give as it might
come to him in the life of the sheeplands. In his heart
he longed for a bed that night, and a cup of hot coffee
to gladden his gizzard. Coffee he had not carried with
him, much less a coffeepot; his load would be heavy
enough without them, he rightly anticipated, before he
reached Tim Sullivan&#8217;s. Nothing more cheering than
water out of the holes by the way had passed his lips
these five days.</p>
<p>He could forgive the woman her song if she would
supply some of the comforts of those who luxuriated in
houses for just this one night. He went on, coming
soon to barbed wire along the way, and presently to a
gap in it that let him in among the trees which concealed
the house.</p>
<p>It was a small, low cabin, quite buried among the
trees, no light showing as Mackenzie drew near, although
the voice of the woman still rose in the plaintive monotony
of her song.</p>
<p>Mackenzie put as much noise into his arrival as was
possible by walking heavily, knowing very well that a
surprise by night is not a good beginning for a claim
of hospitality. The woman must have heard, for her
song ceased in the middle of a word. At the corner of
the house Mackenzie saw a dim light falling through an
open door, into which the shadow of the woman came.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>A little way from the door Mackenzie halted, hat in
hand, giving the woman good evening. She stood within
the threshold a few feet, the light of the lantern hanging
in an angle of the wall over her, bending forward
in the pose of one who listened. She was wiping a plate,
which she held before her breast in the manner of a
shield, stiffly in both hands. Her eyes were large and
full of a frightened surprise, her pale yellow hair was
hanging in slovenly abandon down her cheeks and over
her ears.</p>
<p>She was a tall woman, thin of frame, worn and sad,
but with a faded comeliness of face, more intelligence
apparent in it than is commonly shown by Scandinavian
women of the peasant class who share the labors and the
loads of their men on the isolated homesteads of the
Northwest. She stood so, leaning and staring, her mouth
standing open as if the song had been frightened out so
quickly that it had no time to shut the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, madam,&#8221; said Mackenzie again.</p>
<p>She came out of her paralysis of fright and surprise
at the assuring sound of his voice. He drew nearer,
smiling to show his friendly intention, the lantern light
on the close, flat curls of his fair hair, which lay damp
on temples and forehead.</p>
<p>Tall after his kind was this traveler at her door, spare
of flesh, hollow of cheeks, great of nose, a seriousness in
his eyes which balanced well the marvelous tenderness of
his smile. Not a handsome man, but a man whose simple
goodness shone in his features like a friendly lamp. The
woman in the door advanced a timid step; the color
deepened in her pale and melancholy face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was my man,&#8221; she said, her voice soft
and slow, a labored effort in it to speak without the
harsh dialect so apparent in her song.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a traveler, Mackenzie is my name, on my way
to Tim Sullivan&#8217;s sheep ranch. My grub has run low;
I&#8217;d like to get some supper if you can let me have a
bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not much for a gentleman to eat,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything at all,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, unslinging
his pack, letting it down wearily at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My man would not like it. You have heard of Swan
Carlson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I&#8217;ll pay for it; he&#8217;ll have no right to kick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come far if you have not heard of Swan
Carlson. His name is on the wind like a curse. Better
you would go on, sir; my man would kill you if he found
you in this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved a step to reach and lay the plate on a
table close at hand. As she lifted her foot there was the
sharp clink of metal, as of a dragging chain. Mackenzie
had heard it before when she stepped nearer the
door, and now he bent to look into the shadow that fell
over the floor from the flaring bottom of the lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he, indignantly amazed by the barbarous
thing he beheld, &#8220;does that man keep you a
prisoner here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a dog,&#8221; she said, nodding her untidy head,
lifting her foot to show him the chain.</p>
<p>It was a common trace-chain from plow harness; two
of them, in fact, welded together to give her length to
go about her household work. She had a freedom of not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
more than sixteen feet, one end of the chain welded
about her ankle, the other set in a staple driven into a
log of the wall. She had wrapped the links with cloths
to save her flesh, but for all of that protection she
walked haltingly, as if the limb were sore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of such inhuman treatment!&#8221; Mackenzie
declared, hot to the bone in his burning resentment
of this barbarity. &#8220;How long has he kept you tied
up this way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years now,&#8221; said she, with a weary sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to stop, right here. What did you let
him treat you this way for? Why didn&#8217;t some of your
neighbors take a hand in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody comes,&#8221; she sighed, shaking her head sadly.
&#8220;The name of Swan Carlson is a curse on the wind.
Nobody passes; we are far from any road that men
travel; your face is the first I have seen since Swan put
the chain on me like a wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does he keep his tools?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe in the barn&ndash;&ndash;I do not know. Only there
never is anything left in my reach. Will you set me
free, kind stranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can find anything to cut that chain. Let me
have the lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman hesitated, her eyes grown great with
fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;My man, he is the one who choked two sheepherders
with his hands. You must have read in the paper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it was before my time. Give me down the
lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan Carlson appeared to be a man who got along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
with very few tools. Mackenzie could not find a cold-chisel
among the few broken and rusted odds and ends
in the barn, although there was an anvil, such as every
rancher in that country had, fastened to a stump in the
yard, a hammer rusting beside it on the block. As
Mackenzie stood considering what could be done with
the material at hand, the woman called to him from the
door, her voice vibrant with anxious excitement:</p>
<p>&#8220;My man will come soon,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Mackenzie started back to the house, hammer in hand,
thinking that he might break the chain near her foot
and give her liberty, at least. A pile of logs lay in the
dooryard, an ax hacked into the end of one. With this
tool added to the hammer, he hurried to the prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can make it now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The poor creature was panting as if the hand of her
man hung over her in threat of throttling out her life
as he had smothered the sheepherders in the tragedy
that gave him his evil fame. Mackenzie urged her to a
chair, giving her the lantern to hold and, with the edge
of the ax set against a link of her chain, the poll on the
floor, he began hammering the soft metal against the bit.</p>
<p>Once she put her hand on his shoulder, her breath
caught in a sharp exclamation of alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was Swan&#8217;s step!&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Listen&ndash;&ndash;do you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody,&#8221; he assured her, turning his head
to listen, the sweat on his lean cheek glistening in the
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my fear that he will come too soon. Strike
fast, good young man, strike fast!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>If Swan Carlson had been within half a mile he would
have split the wind to find out the cause of such a clanging
in his shunned and proscribed house, and that he
did not appear before the chain was severed was evidence
that he was nowhere near at hand. When the cut
links fell to the floor Mrs. Carlson stood the lantern
down with gentle deliberation, as if preparing to enter
the chamber of someone in a desperate sickness to whom
had come a blessed respite of sleep. Then she stood, her
lips apart, her breath suspended, lifting her freed foot
with a joyous relief in its lightness.</p>
<p>Mackenzie remained on his knees at her feet, looking
up strangely into her face. Suddenly she bent over
him, clasped his forehead between her hands, kissed his
brow as if he were her son. A great hot tear splashed
down upon his cheek as she rose again, a sob in her
throat that ended in a little, moaning cry. She tossed
her long arms like an eagle set free from a cramping
cage, her head thrown back, her streaming hair far
down her shoulders. There was an appealing grace in
her tall, spare body, a strange, awakening beauty in
her haggard face.</p>
<p>&#8220;God sent you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;May He keep His hand
over you wherever you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie got to his feet; she picked up the ax and
leaned it against the table close to her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you eggs, you can cook them at a fire,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and bread I will give you, but butter I cannot
give. That I have not tasted since I came to this land,
four years ago, a bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved about to get the food, walking with awkwardness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
on the foot that had dragged the chain so
long, laughing a little at her efforts to regain a normal
balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon it will pass away, and I will walk like a lady,
as I once knew how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to cook at a fire,&#8221; Mackenzie protested;
&#8220;I want you to make me some coffee and fry me
some eggs, and then we&#8217;ll see about things.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came close to him, her great gray eyes seeming to
draw him until he gazed into her soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you must go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It will be better when
Swan comes that nobody shall be here but me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you! Why, you poor thing, he&#8217;ll put that chain
on you again, knock you down, for all I know, and
fasten you up like a beast. I&#8217;m not going; I&#8217;ll stay
right here till he comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; shaking her head in sad earnestness, &#8220;better it
will be for all that I shall be here alone when he comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone!&#8221; said he, impatiently; &#8220;what can you do
alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he comes,&#8221; said she, drawing a great breath,
shaking her hair back from her face, her deep grave eyes
holding him again in their earnest appeal, &#8220;then I will
stand by the door and kill him with the ax!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SWAN CARLSON</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie found it hard to bend the woman
from this plan of summary vengeance. She had
suffered and brooded in her loneliness so long, the cruel
hand of Swan Carlson over her, that her thoughts had
beaten a path to this desire. This self-administration of
justice seemed now her life&#8217;s sole aim. She approached
it with glowing eyes and flushed cheeks; she had lived
for that hour.</p>
<p>Harshly she met Mackenzie&#8217;s efforts at first to dissuade
her from this long-planned deed, yielding a little
at length, not quite promising to withhold her hand
when the step of her savage husband should sound outside
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are here when he comes, then it will do for
another night; if you are gone, then I will not say.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the compromise she made with him at last,
turning with no more argument to prepare his supper,
carrying the ax with her as she went about the work.
Often she stood in rigid concentration, listening for the
sound of Swan&#8217;s coming, such animation in her eyes as
a bride&#8217;s might show in a happier hour than hers. She
sat opposite her visitor as he made his supper on the
simple food she gave him, and told him the story of her
adventure into that heartless land, the ax-handle against
her knee.</p>
<p>A minister&#8217;s daughter, educated to fit herself for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
minister&#8217;s wife. She had learned English in the schools
of her native land, as the custom is, and could speak it
fairly when family reverses carried her like a far-blown
seed to America. She had no business training, for what
should a minister&#8217;s wife know of business beyond the
affairs of the parish and the economy of her own home?
She found, therefore, nothing open to her hands in
America save menial work in the households of others.</p>
<p>Not being bred to it, nor the intention or thought of
it as a future contingency, she suffered in humbling herself
to the services of people who were at once her intellectual
and social inferiors. The one advantage in it
was the improvement of her English speech, through
which she hoped for better things in time.</p>
<p>It was while she was still new to America, its customs
and social adjustments, and the shame of her menial
situation burned in her soul like a corrosive acid, that
she saw the advertisement of Swan Carlson in a Swedish
newspaper. Swan Carlson was advertising for a wife.
Beneath a handsome picture of himself he stated his desires,
frankly, with evident honesty in all his representations.
He told of his holdings in sheep and land, of his
money in the bank.</p>
<p>A dream of new consequence in this strange land came
to Hertha Jacobsen as she read the advertisement, as
she studied the features of Swan Carlson, his bold face
looking at her from the page. She had seen men, and
the women of such men sharing their honors, who had
risen from peasants to governors and senators, to positions
of wealth and consequence in this strange land
with all the romance of a tale out of a book. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
fate had urged her on to this unfriendly shore only to
feed her on the bitter herbs for her purification for a
better life.</p>
<p>The minister of her church investigated Swan Carlson
and his claims, finding him all that he professed to be.
Hertha wrote to him; in time Swan came to visit her,
a tall, long-striding man, handsomer than his picture in
the paper, handsome as a Viking lord with his proud
foot on the neck of a fallen foe.</p>
<p>So she married him, and came away with him to the
sheeplands, and Swan&#8217;s hand was as tender of her as a
summer wind. It was shearing time when they reached
home; Swan was with her every day for a little while,
gathering his flocks from the range into the shearing
sheds. He was master of more than fifteen thousand
sheep.</p>
<p>When the shearing was done, and Swan had gone with
his wagons to ship the clip, returning with his bankbook
showing thousands in added wealth, a change came into
her life, so radiant with the blossoms of a new happiness.
Swan&#8217;s big laugh was not so ready in his throat
any more; his great hand seemed forgetful of its caress.
He told her that the time of idling now was over; she
must go with him in a sheep-wagon to the range and
care for her band of sheep, sharing the labors of his life
as she shared its rewards.</p>
<p>No; that was not to her liking. The wife of a rich
man should not live as a peasant woman, dew in her
draggled skirts to her knees, the sun browning her skin
and bleaching her hair. It was not for his woman to
give him <i>no</i>, said Swan. Be ready at a certain hour in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the morning; they must make an early start, for the
way was long.</p>
<p>But no; she refused to take the burden of a peasant
woman on her back. That was the first time Swan
knocked her senseless. When she recovered, the sheep-wagon
was rocking her in its uneasy journey to the distant
range. Swan&#8217;s cruelties multiplied with his impatience
at her slowness to master the shepherd&#8217;s art.
The dogs were sullen creatures, unused to a woman&#8217;s
voice, unfriendly to a woman&#8217;s presence. Swan insisted
that she lay aside her woman&#8217;s attire and dress as a man
to gain the good-will of the dogs.</p>
<p>Again she defied his authority, all her refinement rising
against the degradation of her sex; again Swan laid
her senseless with a blow. When she woke her limbs were
clad in overalls, a greasy jumper was buttoned over her
breast. But the dogs were wiser than their master; no
disguise of man&#8217;s could cover her from the contempt of
their shrewd senses. They would not obey her shrilled
commands.</p>
<p>Very well, said Swan; if she did not have it in her to
win even the respect of a dog, let her do a dog&#8217;s work.
So he took the collies away, leaving her to range her
band of sheep in terrible labor, mind-wrenching loneliness,
over the sage-gray hills. Wolves grew bold; the
lambs suffered. When Swan came again to number her
flock, he cursed her for her carelessness, giving her blows
which were kinder than his words.</p>
<p>With the first snow she abandoned her flock and fled.
Disgraceful as it was for a woman to leave her man, the
frenzy of loneliness drove her on. With his companionship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
she could have endured Swan&#8217;s cruelty, but alone
her heart was dead. Three days she wandered. Swan
found her after she had fallen in the snow.</p>
<p>His great laugh woke her, and she was home in this
house, the light of day in her eyes. Swan was sitting
beside her, merry in the thought of how he had cheated
her out of her intention to die like an old ewe among
the mountain drifts.</p>
<p>She was good for nothing, he said, but to sit at home
like a cat. But he would make sure that she sat at home,
to be there at his coming, and not running away from
the bounty of a man who had taken a beggar to his
bosom. Then he brought the chain and the anvil, and
welded the red-hot iron upon her limb. He laughed
when the smoke of her burning flesh rose hissing;
laughed when he mounted his horse and rode away,
leaving her in agony too great to let her die.</p>
<p>This summer now beginning was the fourth since that
melancholy day. In the time that had passed, Swan had
come into the ways of trouble, suffering a great drain
upon his hoarded money, growing as a consequence sullen
and somber in his moods. No more he laughed; even
the distress of his chained wife, the sight of her wasting
face and body, the pleading of her tortured eyes, could
not move his loud gales of merriment again.</p>
<p>Swan had killed two of his sheepherders, as she had
mentioned before. It grew out of a dispute over wages,
in which the men were right. That was the winter following
her attempt to run away, Swan being alone with
them upon the stormy range. He declared both of them
set upon him at once like wolves, and that he fought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
only to defend his life. He strangled them, the throat
of each grasped in his broad, thick hand, and held them
from him so, stiff arms against their desperate struggles,
until they sank down in the snow and died.</p>
<p>Only a little while ago the lawyers had got him off
from the charge of murder, after long delays. The case
had been tried in another county, for Swan Carlson&#8217;s
neighbors all believed him guilty of a horrible crime; no
man among them could have listened to his story under
oath with unprejudiced ear. The lawyers had brought
Swan off, for at the end it had been his living word
against the mute accusations of two dead men. There
was nobody to speak for the herders; so the lawyers had
set him free. But it had cost him thousands of dollars,
and Swan&#8217;s evil humor had deepened with the drain.</p>
<p>Crazy, he said of his wife; a poor mad thing bent on
self-destruction in wild and mournful ways. In that
Swan was believed, at least. Nobody came to inquire of
her, none ever stopped to speak a word. The nearest
neighbor was twelve or fifteen miles distant, a morose
man with sour face, master of a sea of sheep.</p>
<p>All of this Swan himself had told her in the days
when he laughed. He told her also of the lawyers&#8217; drain
upon his wealth, starving her days together to make a
pebble of saving to fill the ruthless breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight Swan will come,&#8221; she said. &#8220;After what I
have told you, are you not afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to be,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, leaving
her to form her own conclusion.</p>
<p>She searched his face with steady eyes, her hand on
the ax-helve, in earnest effort to read his heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, you are not afraid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But wait; when
you hear him speak, then you will be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know he is coming home tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not speak at once. Her eyes were fixed on
the open door at Mackenzie&#8217;s side, her face was set in
the tensity of her mental concentration as she listened.
Mackenzie bent all his faculties to hear if any foot
approached. There was no sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fishermen of my country can feel the chill of an
iceberg through the fog and the night,&#8221; she said at last.
&#8220;Swan Carlson is an iceberg to my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>She listened again, bending forward, her lips open.
Mackenzie fancied he heard the swing of a galloping
hoof-beat, and turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a pistol?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming; in a little while he will be at the door.
There is time yet for you to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to have a word with your man; I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson got up, keeping the ax in hand, moved
her chair to the other side of the door, where she stationed
herself in such position as Swan must see her first
when he looked within. She disposed the ax to conceal
it entirely beneath her long apron, her hand under the
garment grasping the helve.</p>
<p>&#8220;For your own sake, not his, I ask you not to strike
him,&#8221; Mackenzie pleaded, in all the earnestness he could
command.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given you the hour of my vengeance,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;But if he curses me, if he lifts his hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was more than a little uneasy on the probable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
outcome of his meeting with the tempestuous Swan.
He got out his pipe and lit it, considering the situation
with fast-running thoughts. Still, a man could not go
on and leave that beaten, enslaved woman to the mercies
of her tyrant; Swan Carlson must be given to understand
that he would be held to answer to the law for his
future behavior toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you I&#8217;d put the ax behind the door and
get his supper ready,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson got up at the suggestion, with such
readiness that surprised Mackenzie, put the ax back of
the open door, stood a moment winding up her fallen
hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is my man,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Swan was turning his horse into the barn; Mackenzie
could hear him talking to the animal, not unkindly.
Mrs. Carlson put fresh fuel in the stove, making a rattling
of the lids which must have sounded cheerful to the
ears of a hungry man. As she began breaking eggs into
a bowl she took up her song again, with an unconscious
air of detachment from it, as one unwittingly follows
the habit that has been for years the accompaniment to
a task.</p>
<p>As before, the refinement of accent was wanting in
her words, but the sweet melancholy of her voice thrilled
her listener like the rich notes of an ancient violin.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

Na-fer to leafe me a-lone!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Mackenzie sat with his elbow on the table, his chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
partly turned toward the door, just within the threshold
and a little to one side, where the flockmaster would see
him the moment he stepped into the light. The traveler&#8217;s
pack lay on the floor at the door jamb; the smoke
from his pipe drifted out to tell of his presence in the
honest announcement of a man who had nothing to hide.</p>
<p>So Swan Carlson found him as he came home to his
door.</p>
<p>Swan stopped, one foot in the door, the light on his
face. Mrs. Carlson did not turn from the stove to greet
him by word or look, but stood bending a little over the
pan of sputtering eggs, which she shook gently from
side to side with a rhythmic, slow movement in cadence
with her song. Swan turned his eyes from one to the
other, his face clouding for a moment as for a burst of
storm, clearing again at once as Mackenzie rose and
gave him good evening in cheerful and unshaken voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson had spoken a true word when she described
Swan as a handsome man. Almost seven feet
tall, Mackenzie took him to be, so tall that he must
stoop to enter the door; lithe and sinewy of limbs, a
lightness in them as of an athlete bred; broad in the
shoulders, long of arms. His face was stern, his red
hair long about the ears, his Viking mustache long-drooping
at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought a man was here, or my woman had begun
to smoke,&#8221; said Swan, coming in, flinging his hat down
on the floor. &#8220;What do you want, loafin&#8217; around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie explained his business in that country in
direct words, and his presence in the house in the same
breath. Mollified, Swan grunted that he understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and accepted the explanation, turning up his sleeves,
unfastening the collar of his flannel shirt, to wash. His
woman stood at the stove, her song dead on her lips,
sliding the eggs from the pan onto a platter in one
piece. Swan gave her no heed, not even a curious or
questioning look, but as he crossed the room to the wash
bench he saw the broken chain lying free upon the floor.</p>
<p>A breath he paused over it, his eyes fastened on it in
a glowering stare. Mackenzie braced himself for the
storm of wrath which seemed bursting the doors of Swan
Carlson&#8217;s gloomy heart. But Swan did not speak. He
picked up the chain, examined the cut link, threw it
down with a clatter. At the sound of its fall Mackenzie
saw Mrs. Carlson start. She turned her head, terror in
her eyes, her face blanched. Swan bent over the basin,
snorting water like a strangling horse.</p>
<p>There were eight eggs on the platter that Swan Carlson&#8217;s
woman put before him when he sat down to his
supper. One end of the great trencher was heaped with
brown bacon; a stack of bread stood at Swan&#8217;s left
hand, a cup of coffee at his right. Before this provender
the flockmaster squared himself, the unwelcome
guest across the table from him, the smoke of his pipe
drifting languidly out into the tranquil summer night.</p>
<p>Swan had said no word since his first inquiry. Mackenzie
had ventured nothing more. Mrs. Carlson sat
down in the chair that she had placed near the door
before Swan&#8217;s arrival, only that she moved it a little to
bring her hand within reach of the hidden ax.</p>
<p>Swan had brushed his long, dark-red hair back from
his broad, deep forehead, bringing it down across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
tips of his ears in a savage fashion admirably suited to
his grave, harsh, handsome face. He devoured his food
noisily, bending low over his plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to learn the sheep business, huh?&#8221; said he,
throwing up his eyes in quick challenge, pausing a
moment in his champing and clatter. Mackenzie nodded,
pipe raised toward his lips. &#8220;Well, you come to the
right country. You ever had any work around a ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t think you had; you look too soft. How
much can you lift?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with sheep?&#8221; Mackenzie inquired,
frowning in his habitual manner of showing displeasure
with frivolous and trifling things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can shoulder a steel rail off of the railroad that
weighs seven hundred and fifty pounds,&#8221; said Swan.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t lift one end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Mackenzie allowed, pretending
to gaze out after his drifting smoke, but watching the
sheepman, as he mopped the last of the eggs up with a
piece of bread, with a furtive turning of his eye. He
was considering how to approach the matter which he
had remained there to take up with this great, boasting,
savage man, and how he could make him understand
that it was any of society&#8217;s business whether he chained
his wife or let her go free, fed her or starved her, caressed
her, or knocked her down.</p>
<p>Swan pushed back from the table, wringing the coffee
from his mustache.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you cut that chain?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I cut it. You&#8217;ve got no right to keep your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
wife, or anybody else, chained up. You could be put in
jail for it; it&#8217;s against the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s got a right to do what he pleases with his
own woman; she&#8217;s his property, the same as a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly the same as a horse, either. But you
could be put in jail for beating your horse. I&#8217;ve waited
here to tell you about this, in a friendly way, and warn
you to treat this woman right. Maybe you didn&#8217;t know
you were breaking the law, but I&#8217;m telling you it&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan stood, his head within six inches of the ceiling.
His wife must have read an intention of violence in his
face, although Mackenzie could mark no change in his
features, always as immobile as bronze. She sprang to
her feet, her bosom agitated, arms lifted, shoulders
raised, as if to shrink from the force of a blow. She
made no effort to reach the ax behind the door; the
thought of it had gone, apparently, out of her mind.</p>
<p>Swan stood within four feet of her, but he gave her
no attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a man comes to my house and monkeys with
my woman, him and me we&#8217;ve got to have a fight,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie got up, keeping the table between
them. He looked at the door, calculating
whether he could make a spring for the ax before Carlson
could grapple him. Carlson read in the glance an
intention to retreat, made a quick stride to the door,
closed it sharply, locked it, put the key in his pocket.
He stood a moment looking Mackenzie over, as if surprised
by the length he unfolded when on his feet, but
with no change of anger or resentment in his stony face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t need to lock the door, Carlson; I wasn&#8217;t
going to run away&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t wait here to see you for
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood in careless, lounging pose, hand on
the back of his chair, pipe between his fingers, a rather
humorous look in his eyes as he measured Carlson up
and down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out here in the middle and fight me if you
ain&#8217;t afraid!&#8221; Swan challenged, derision in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight you, all right, after I tell you what I waited
here to say. You&#8217;re a coward, Swan Carlson, you&#8217;re a
sheepman with a sheep&#8217;s heart. I turned your woman
loose, and you&#8217;re going to let her stay loose. Let that
sink into your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlson was standing a few feet in front of Mackenzie,
leaning forward, his shoulders swelling and falling
as if he flexed his muscles for a spring. His arms he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
held swinging in front of him full length, like a runner
waiting for the start, in a posture at once unpromising
and uncouth. Behind him his wife shuddered against
the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan, Swan! O-o-oh, Swan, Swan!&#8221; she said, crying
it softly as if she chided him for a great hurt.</p>
<p>Swan turned partly toward her, striking backward
with his open hand. His great knuckles struck her
across the eyes, a cruel, heavy blow that would have
felled a man. She staggered back a pace, then sank
limply forward on her knees, her hands outreaching on
the floor, her hair falling wildly, her posture that of a
suppliant at a barbarian conqueror&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>Mackenzie snatched the heavy platter from the table
and brought Carlson a smashing blow across the head.
Carlson stood weaving on his legs a moment as the fragments
of the dish clattered around him, swaying like a
tree that waits the last blow of the ax to determine
which way it will fall. Mackenzie threw the fragment
that remained in his hand into Carlson&#8217;s face, laying
open a long gash in his cheek. As the hot blood gushed
down over his jaw Carlson steadied himself on his swaying
legs and laughed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson lifted her face out of the shadows of
the floor at the sound. Mackenzie glanced at her, the
red mark of Swan&#8217;s harsh blow across her brows, as he
flew at Swan like a desert whirlwind, landing heavily on
his great neck before he could lift a guard. The blow
staggered Carlson over upon his wife, and together they
collapsed against the wall, where Carlson stood a breath,
his hand thrown out to save him from a fall. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
shook his haughty, handsome, barbarian head, and
laughed again, a loud laugh, deep and strong.</p>
<p>There was no note of merriment in that sound, no inflection
of satisfaction or joy. It came out of his wide-extended
jaws with a roar, no facial softening with it,
no blending of the features in the transformation of a
smile. Mrs. Carlson struggled to her knees at the sound
of it, lifting her moaning cry again at the sight of his
gushing blood. Swan charged his adversary with bent
head, the floor trembling under his heavy feet, his great
hands lifted to seize and crush.</p>
<p>Mackenzie backed away, upsetting the table between
them, barring for a moment Swan&#8217;s mad onrush. In the
anger-blind movements of the man he could read his intention,
which was not to strike foot to foot, knee to
knee, but to grapple and smother, as he had smothered
the sheepherders in the snow. Across the overturned
table Mackenzie landed another blow, sprang around the
barrier out of the pocket of corner into which Carlson
was bent on forcing him, hoping by nimble foot work to
play on the flockmaster for a knockout.</p>
<p>Swan threw a chair as Mackenzie circled out of his
reach with nimble feet, knocking down the stovepipe,
dislodging a shower of tinware from the shelves behind.
Carlson had him by the shoulder now, but a deft turn, a
sharp blow, and Mackenzie was free, racing over the
cluttered floor in wild uproar, bending, side-stepping, in
a strained and terrific race. Carlson picked up the
table, swung it overhead until it struck the ceiling, threw
it with all his mighty strength to crush the man who had
evaded him with such clever speed. A leg caught Mackenzie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
a glancing blow on the head, dazing him momentarily,
giving Carlson the opening he desired.</p>
<p>In the next breath Mackenzie was down, Carlson&#8217;s
hand at his throat. Mackenzie could see Swan&#8217;s face as
he bent over him, the lantern light on it fairly. There
was no light of exultation in it as his great hand closed
slowly upon Mackenzie&#8217;s throat, no change from its
stony harshness save for the dark gash and the flood of
blood that ran down his jaw and neck.</p>
<p>Mackenzie writhed and struggled, groping on the
floor for something to strike Carlson with and break his
garroting grip. The blood was singing in his ears, the
breath was cut from his lungs; his eyes flashed a
thousand scintillating sparks and grew dark. His hand
struck something in the debris on the floor, the handle
of a table knife it seemed, and with the contact a
desperate accession of life heaved in him like a final wave.
He struck, and struck at Swan Carlson&#8217;s arm, and
struck again at his wrist as he felt the tightening band
of his fingers relax, heard him curse and growl. A quick
turn and he was free, with a glimpse as he rolled over
at Swan Carlson pulling a table fork out of his hairy
wrist.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt blood in his mouth; his ears were
muffled as if he were under water, but he came to his
feet with a leg of the broken table in his hand. Swan
threw the fork at him as he rose from his knees; it
struck the lantern, breaking the globe, cutting off more
than half the dim light in which the undetermined battle
had begun.</p>
<p>Over against the door Mrs. Carlson stood with the ax
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
in her hands, holding it uplifted, partly drawn back, as
if she had checked it in an intended blow. Swan tore a
broad plank from the table top, split it over his knee to
make it better fit his hand, and came on to the attack,
bending in his slouching, bearish attitude of defiant
strength. Mackenzie gave way before him, watching his
moment to strike the decisive blow.</p>
<p>This maneuver brought Mackenzie near the door,
where the wild-eyed woman stood, an ally and a reserve,
ready to help him in the moment of his extremity. He
believed she had been on the point of striking Swan the
moment his fingers closed in their convulsive pang of
death over the handle of the fork.</p>
<p>Swan followed, warily now, conscious of this man&#8217;s
unexpected strength and agility, and of his resources in
a moment of desperation, making feints with his board
as a batter does before the ball is thrown. Mackenzie
passed Mrs. Carlson, backing away from Swan, sparring
for time to recover his wind and faculties after his swift
excursion to the borderland of death. He parried a
swift blow, giving one in return that caught Swan on
the elbow and knocked the plank out of his hand. Mackenzie
sprang forward to follow up his advantage with
a decisive stroke, when, to his amazement, Mrs. Carlson
threw herself between them, the ax uplifted in her husband&#8217;s
defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she screamed; &#8220;he is my man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan Carlson laughed again, and patted her shoulder,
stooping to recover his board. But he flung it
down again, taking the ax in its place, pushing his
woman, not without some tenderness in his hand, back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
into the corner, throwing himself in front of her, his
wild laugh ringing in the murky room, stifling from the
smoke of lantern and stove.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt his hope break like a rope of straw at
this unexpected turn of the woman. With those two
mad creatures&ndash;&ndash;for mad he believed the isolation and
cruelty suffered by the one, the trouble and terror of
the law by the other, had driven them&ndash;&ndash;leagued against
him it seemed that he must put down all hope of ever
looking again upon the day.</p>
<p>If there was any chance for him at all, it lay in darkness.
With this thought Mackenzie made a quick dash
past Carlson, smashing the lantern with a blow.</p>
<p>There was one window in the room, a small, single-sash
opening near the stove. Even this was not apparent
for a little while following the plunge into the
dark; Mackenzie stood still, waiting for his eyes to adjust
themselves to the gloom. No sound but Carlson&#8217;s
breathing came from the other side of the kitchen. The
square of window appeared dimly now, a little to Mackenzie&#8217;s
left. He moved cautiously away from it, yet not
without noise for all his care. Swan let drive with his
board at the sound of movement. His aim was good;
it struck Mackenzie&#8217;s shoulder, but fortunately with its
flat surface, doing no hurt.</p>
<p>Mackenzie threw himself down heavily, getting cautiously
to his feet again instantly, hoping to draw Carlson
over in the belief that he had put him out of the
fight. But Carlson was not so rash. He struck a match,
holding it up, peering under it, blinking in the sudden
light.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie was not more than eight feet away. He
closed the distance in a bound, swung the heavy oak
table leg, and stretched Carlson on the floor. Mrs.
Carlson began wailing and moaning, bending over her
fallen tyrant, as Mackenzie could gather from her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve killed him,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you&#8217;ve killed my
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I will kill him if you don&#8217;t open the door!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood by Carlson as he spoke, feeling his
body with his foot. He bent over Carlson, exploring for
his heart, fearing that he had killed him, indeed. His
first efforts to locate a pulse were not assuring, but a
feeble throbbing at last announced that the great ruffian&#8217;s
admirable machinery was stunned, not broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the door; he&#8217;ll be all right in a little while,&#8221;
Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson was moaning in a sorrow as genuine as
if the fallen man had been the kindest husband that fate
could have sent her, and not the heartless beast that he
was. She found the key and threw the door open, letting
in a cool, sweet breath of the night. Under it Carlson
would soon revive, Mackenzie believed. He had no
desire to linger and witness the restoration.</p>
<p>Mackenzie had a bruised and heavy feeling about him
as he shouldered his pack and hurried from that inhospitable
door. He knew that Swan Carlson was not dead,
and would not die from that blow. Why the feeling persisted
as he struck off up the creek through the dew-wet
grass he could not tell, but it was strong upon him
that Swan Carlson would come into his way again, to
make trouble for him on a future day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>KEEPER OF THE FLOCK</h3>
</div>
<p>John Mackenzie, late schoolmaster of Jasper,
marched on through the cool of the night, regretting
that he had meddled in the domestic arrangements
of Swan Carlson, the Swede. The outcome of his attempted
kindness to the oppressed woman had not been
felicitous. Indeed, he was troubled greatly by the fear
that he had killed Swan Carlson, and that grave consequences
might rise out of this first adventure that ever
fell in his way.</p>
<p>Perhaps adventure was not such a thing to be sought
as he had imagined, he reflected; hand to his swollen
throat. There was an ache in his crushed windpipe, a
dryness in his mouth, a taste of blood on his tongue.
That had been a close go for him, there on the floor under
Swan Carlson&#8217;s great knee; a few seconds longer,
and his first adventure would have been his last.</p>
<p>Yet there was a vast satisfaction in knowing what was
in him. Here he had stood foot to foot with the strong
man of the sheeplands, the strangler, the fierce, half-insane
terror of peaceful men, and had come off the
victor. He had fought this man in his own house, where
a man will fight valiantly, even though a coward on the
road, and had left him senseless on the floor. It was
something for a schoolteacher, counted a mild and
childlike man.</p>
<p>It had been many a year since Mackenzie had mixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
in a fight, and the best that had gone before was nothing
more than a harmless spat compared to this. The marvel
of it was how he had developed this quality of defense
in inactivity. There must have been some psychological
undercurrent carrying strength and skill to
him through all the years of his romantic imaginings;
the spirits of old heroes of that land must have lent him
their counsel and might in that desperate battle with
the Norse flockmaster.</p>
<p>Adventure was not dead out of the land, it seemed,
although this was a rather sordid and ignoble brand. It
had descended to base levels among base men who lived
with sheep and thought only of sheep-riches. Violence
among such men as Swan Carlson was merely violence,
with none of the picturesque embellishments of the olden
days when men slung pistols with a challenge and a hail,
in those swift battles where skill was all, bestial strength
nothing.</p>
<p>Mackenzie hoped to find Tim Sullivan different from
the general run of sheep-rich men. There must be some
of the spice of romance in a man who had the wide reputation
of Tim Sullivan, and who was the hero of so
many tales of success.</p>
<p>It was Mackenzie&#8217;s hope that this encounter with the
wild sheepman might turn out to his profit with Tim
Sullivan. He always had believed that he should win
fortune fighting if it ever fell to his portion at all.
This brush with Swan Carlson confirmed his old belief.
If there was any good luck for him in the sheep country,
it would come to him through a fight,</p>
<p>Mackenzie considered these things as he marched on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
away from Swan Carlson&#8217;s homestead, thinking the safe
plan would be to put several miles between himself and
that place before lying down to rest. At dawn Swan
would be out after him with a gun, more than likely.
Mackenzie had nothing of the sort in his slender equipment.
Imagine a man going into the sheep country
carrying a gun! The gun days of the West were done;
he had seen only one cowboy wearing one in his four
years at Jasper.</p>
<p>Past midnight Mackenzie came to a little valley where
somebody had been cutting hay. The late-risen moon
discovered the little mounds of hay thick around him,
the aroma of the curing herbage was blowing to him an
invitation to stop and sleep. Let Swan Carlson come
when he might, that was the place prepared for the
traveler&#8217;s repose.</p>
<p>Romance or no romance, riches or poverty, he was
through with a woman&#8217;s work, he told himself. Once
there had been ideals ahead of him in educational work,
but the contempt of men had dispelled them. If he
could not find his beginning in the sheep country, he
would turn elsewhere. A man who had it in him to fight
giants wasn&#8217;t cut out for teaching school.</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat with his back to a haycock thinking in
this vein. The sound of running water was near; he
went to the creek and bathed his throat, easing its burning
with a deep swig. Back again to the hay, still building
new victories, and nobler ones, on the foundation of
this triumph over Swan Carlson, the red giant who
choked men to death in the snow.</p>
<p>Morning discovered no habitation in reach of the eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
That little field of mown hay stood alone among the
gray hills, unfenced, unfended, secure in its isolation, a
little patch of something in the wilderness that looked
like home. Mackenzie must have put many miles behind
him since leaving Carlson&#8217;s door. Looking back, he
could follow the course of the creek where it snaked
through the hills, dark green of willow and cottonwood
fresh among the hemming slopes of sage, but no trace of
Carlson&#8217;s trees could he see.</p>
<p>Mackenzie had no flour to mix a wad of dough, and
but a heel of a bacon side to furnish a breakfast. It
was so unpromising in his present hungry state that he
determined to tramp on a few miles in the hope of lifting
Tim Sullivan&#8217;s ranch-house on the prominent hilltop
where, he had been told, it stood.</p>
<p>Two or three miles beyond the hay-field Mackenzie
came suddenly upon a sheep-camp. The wagon stood
on a green hillside, a pleasant valley below it where the
grass was abundant and sweet. The camp evidently had
been stationed in that place but a little while, for a
large band of sheep grazed just below it, no bedding-ground
being worn bare in the unusual verdure. Altogether,
it was the greenest and most promising place
Mackenzie had met in his journey, gladdening at once to
the imagination and the eye.</p>
<p>The shepherd sat on the hillside, his dogs beside him,
a little smoke ascending straight in the calm, early
sunshine from his dying fire. The collies scented the
stranger while he stood on the hilltop, several hundred
yards above the camp, rising to question his presence
bristling backs. The shepherd rose to inquire into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
the alarm, springing up with amazing agility, such sudden
and wild concern in his manner as provoked the
traveler&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>Mackenzie saw that he was a boy of fifteen or thereabout,
dressed in overalls much too large for him, the
bottoms turned up almost to his knees. Hot as the
morning was beginning, the lad had on a duck coat with
sheepskin collar, but in the excitement of beholding a
visitor approaching his camp so early in the day, he
took off his hat, standing so a moment. Then he cut
out a streak for the wagon, a few rods distant, throwing
back a half-frightened look as he disappeared around
its side.</p>
<p>This was a very commodious wagon, familiar to Mackenzie
from having seen many like it drawn up for
repairs at the blacksmith shops in Jasper. Its heavy canvas
top was stretched tightly over bows, made to withstand
wind and rough weather, a stovepipe projecting
through it, fended about with a broad tin, and a canvas
door, with a little window in it, a commodious step letting
down to the ground. Its tongue was cut short, to
admit coupling it close behind the camp-mover&#8217;s wagon,
and it was a snug and comfortable home on wheels.</p>
<p>The dogs came slowly to meet Mackenzie as he approached,
backs still bristling, countenances unpromising.
The boy had disappeared into the wagon; Mackenzie
wondered if he had gone to fetch his gun.</p>
<p>But no. Instead of a gun, came a girl, neither timidity
nor fear in her bearing, and close behind her came
the boy, hat still in his hand, his long, straight hair
down about his ears. Mackenzie had stopped a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
yards or so distant, not confident of a friendly reception
from the dogs. The girl waved her hand in invitation
for him to come on, and stood waiting at the wagon end.</p>
<p>She was as neatly dressed as the lad beside her was
uncouth in his man-size overalls, her short corduroy
skirt belted about with a broad leather clasped with a
gleaming silver buckle, the tops of her tall laced boots
lost beneath its hem. Her gray flannel waist was laced
at the bosom like a cowboy&#8217;s shirt, adorned at the collar
with a flaming scarlet necktie done in a bow as broad as
a band. Her brown sombrero was tilted, perhaps unintentionally,
a little to one side of her rather pert and
independently carried head.</p>
<p>At a word from her the dogs left the way unopposed,
and as greetings passed between the sheepgirl and the
stranger the wise creatures stood beside her, eyeing the
visitor over with suspicious mien. Mackenzie told his
name and his business, making inquiry in the same
breath for Tim Sullivan&#8217;s ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Mr. Sullivan?&#8221; she asked. And as she
lifted her eyes Mackenzie saw that they were as blue as
asters on an October morning, and that her hair was a
warm reddish-brown, and that her face was refreshingly
pure in its outline, strong and haughty and brown, and
subtly sweet as the elusive perfume of a wild rose of the
hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know Mr. Sullivan; I&#8217;ve never even seen
him. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about him down at Jasper&ndash;&ndash;I was
the schoolteacher there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re up here on your vacation?&#8221; said she, a
light of quick interest in her eyes, an unmistakable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
friendliness in her voice. It was as if he had presented
a letter from somebody well and favorably known.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve come up here to see about learning the
sheep business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep business?&#8221; said she, looking at him with surprised
eyes. &#8220;Sheep business?&#8221; this time with a shading
of disgust. &#8220;Well, if I had sense enough to teach school
I&#8217;d never want to see another sheep!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie smiled at her impetuous outburst in which
she revealed in a word the discontent of her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you know Mr. Sullivan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my father,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;This is my brother
Charley; there are eight more of us at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charley grinned, his shyness still over him, but his
alarm quieted, and gave Mackenzie his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ranch is about thirteen or fifteen miles on up
the creek from here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;You haven&#8217;t had your
breakfast, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I just about finished my grub yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any grease around your gills,&#8221; said the
girl, in quite a matter-of-fact way, no flippancy in her
manner. &#8220;Charley, stir up the fire, will you? I can&#8217;t
offer you much, Mr. Mackenzie, but you&#8217;re welcome to
what there is. How about a can of beans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit me right where I live, Miss Sullivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collies came warily up, stiff-legged, with backs
still ruffled, and sniffed Mackenzie over. They seemed
to find him harmless, turning from him presently to go
and lie beside Charley, their faces toward the flock, alert
ears lifted, white breasts gleaming in the sun like the
linen of fastidious gentlemen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to get any water, Joan?&#8221; Charley
inquired.</p>
<p>Joan answered from inside the wagon that no water
was needed, there was coffee enough in the pot. She
handed the smoke-blackened vessel out to Mackenzie as
she spoke, telling him to go and put it on the fire.</p>
<p>Joan turned the beans into the pan after cooking the
bacon, and sent Charley to the wagon for a loaf of
bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to bake bread in this camp, that&#8217;s one
blessing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mother keeps us supplied. Some
of these sheepherders never taste anything but their
cold-water biscuits for years at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must get kind of tiresome,&#8221; Mackenzie reflected,
thinking of his own efforts at bread-making on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too heavy to carry around in the craw,&#8221; said
Joan.</p>
<p>Charley watched Mackenzie curiously as he ate, whispering
once to his sister, who flushed, turned her eyes a
moment on her visitor, and then seemed to rebuke the
lad for passing confidences in such impolite way. Mackenzie
guessed that his discolored neck and bruised face
had been the subject of the boy&#8217;s conjectures, but he did
not feel pride enough in his late encounter to speak of
it even in explanation. Charley opened the way to it at
last when Joan took the breakfast things back to the
wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been in a fight?&#8221; the boy inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a one,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, rather
wishing that the particulars might be reserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your neck&#8217;s black like somebody&#8217;d been chokin&#8217; you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
and your face is bunged up some, too. Who done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Swan Carlson?&#8221; Mackenzie inquired,
turning slowly to the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan Carlson?&#8221; Charley&#8217;s face grew pale at the
name; his eyes started in round amazement. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t never &#8217;a&#8217; got away from Swan; he choked two
fellers to death, one in each hand. No man in this
country could whip one side of Swan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I got away from him, anyhow,&#8221; said Mackenzie,
in a manner that even the boy understood to be
the end of the discussion.</p>
<p>But Charley was not going to have it so. He jumped
up and ran to meet Joan as she came from the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mackenzie had a fight with Swan Carlson&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the matter with his neck!&#8221; he said. There
was unbounded admiration in the boy&#8217;s voice, and exultation
as if the distinction were his own. Here before
his eyes was a man who had come to grips with Swan
Carlson, and had escaped from his strangling hands to
eat his breakfast with as much unconcern as if he had
no more than been kicked by a mule.</p>
<p>Joan came on a little quicker, excitement reflected in
her lively eyes. Mackenzie was filling his pipe, which
had gone through the fight in his pocket in miraculous
safety&ndash;&ndash;for which he was duly grateful&ndash;&ndash;ashamed of
his bruises, now that the talk of them had brought them
to Joan&#8217;s notice again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you killed him,&#8221; she said, coming near, looking
down on Mackenzie with full commendation; &#8220;he
keeps his crazy wife chained up like a dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead, but I&#8217;d like to know for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
sure,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, his eyes bent thoughtfully on
the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody will ever say a word to you if you did kill
him,&#8221; Joan assured. &#8220;They&#8217;d all know he started it&ndash;&ndash;he
fusses with everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat on the ground near him, Charley posting himself
a little in front, where he could admire and wonder
over the might of a man who could break Swan Carlson&#8217;s
hold upon his throat and leave his house alive. Before
them the long valley widened as it reached away, the
sheep a dusty brown splotch in it, spread at their grazing,
the sound of the lambs&#8217; wailing rising clear in the
pastoral silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped at Carlson&#8217;s house after dark last night,&#8221;
Mackenzie explained, seeing that such explanation must
be made, &#8220;and turned his wife loose. Carlson resented
it when he came home. He said I&#8217;d have to fight him.
But you&#8217;re wrong when you believe what Carlson says
about that woman; she isn&#8217;t crazy, and never was.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seemed to be all the story, from the way he
hastened it, and turned away from the vital point of
interest. Joan touched his arm as he sat smoking, his
speculative gaze on the sheep, his brows drawn as if in
troubled thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do when he said you had to fight
him?&#8221; she inquired, her breath coming fast, her cheeks
glowing.</p>
<p>Mackenzie laughed shortly. &#8220;Why, I tried to get
away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you, before he got his hands on you?&#8221;
Charley wanted to know.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Charley!&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlson locked the door before I could get out.&#8221;
Mackenzie nodded to the boy, very gravely, as one man
to another. Charley laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tear up no boards off the floor tryin&#8217; to
git away!&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>Joan smiled; that seemed to express her opinion of
it, also. She admired the schoolmaster&#8217;s modest reluctance
when he gave them a bare outline of what followed,
shuddering when he laughed over Mrs. Carlson&#8217;s defense
of her husband with the ax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Charley, &#8220;I hope dad&#8217;ll give you a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get out of there?&#8221; Joan asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took an unfair advantage of Swan and hit him
with a table leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! dad&#8217;s <i>got</i> to give you a job,&#8221; said Charley;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold you to that, Charley,&#8221; Mackenzie laughed.</p>
<p>In the boy&#8217;s eyes Mackenzie was already a hero,
greater than any man that had come into the sheeplands
in his day. Sheep people are not fighting folks.
They never have been since the world&#8217;s beginning; they
never will be to the world&#8217;s end. There is something in
the peaceful business of attending sheep, some appeal
in their meekness and passivity, that seems to tincture
and curb the savage spirit that dwells in the breast of
man. Swan Carlson was one of the notorious exceptions
in that country. Even the cattlemen were afraid of
him.</p>
<p>Joan advised against Mackenzie&#8217;s expressed intention
of returning to Carlson&#8217;s house to find out how badly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
he was hurt. It would be a blessing to the country, she
said, if it should turn out that Carlson was killed. But
Mackenzie had an uneasy feeling that it would be a
blessing he could not share. He was troubled over the
thing, now that the excitement of the fight had cooled
out of him, thinking of the blow he had given Carlson
with that heavy piece of oak.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fellow was not dead, but hurt so badly
that he would die without surgical aid. It was the part
of duty and humanity to go back and see. He resolved
to do this, keeping the resolution to himself.</p>
<p>Joan told him much of the sheep business, and much
about the art of running a big band over that sparse
range, in which this green valley lay like an oasis, a
gladdening sight seldom to be met with among those
sulky hills. She said she hoped her father would find
a place for him, for the summer, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t like to see you shut yourself up in
this country like the rest of us are,&#8221; she said, gazing off
over the hills with wistful eyes. &#8220;A man that knows
enough to teach school oughtn&#8217;t fool away his time on
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was working toward her own emancipation, she
told him, running that band of two thousand sheep on
shares for her father, just the same as an ordinary
herdsman. In three years she hoped her increase, and
share of the clip, would be worth ten thousand dollars,
and then she would sell out and go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you want to leave a good business like
this for?&#8221; he asked, rather astonished at her cool calculation
upon what she believed to be freedom. &#8220;There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
nothing out in what people call the world that you could
turn your hand to that would make you a third of the
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go away and get some education,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are educated, Miss Sullivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned a slow, reproachful look upon him, a
shadow of sadness over her wholesome young face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nearly nineteen; I don&#8217;t know as much as a girl
of twelve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never met any of those precocious twelve-year-olds,&#8221;
he told her, shaking his head gravely. &#8220;You
know a great deal more than you&#8217;re conscious of, I
think, Miss Sullivan. We don&#8217;t get the best of it out of
books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a prisoner here,&#8221; she said, stretching her arms
as if she displayed her bonds, &#8220;as much of a prisoner in
my way as Swan Carlson&#8217;s wife was in hers. You cut
her chain; nobody ever has come to cut mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your knight will come riding over the hill some
evening. One comes into every woman&#8217;s life, sooner or
later, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly in imagination,&#8221; said Joan. And her way
of saying it, so wise and superior, as if she spoke of
some toy which she had outgrown, brought a smile again
to her visitor&#8217;s grave face.</p>
<p>Charley was not interested in his sister&#8217;s bondage, or
in the coming of a champion to set her free. He went
off to send the dogs after an adventurous bunch of
sheep that was straying from the main flock. Joan
sighed as she looked after him, putting a strand of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
hair away behind her ear. Presently she brightened,
turning to Mackenzie with quickening eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a bargain with you, Mr. Mackenzie, if
you&#8217;re in earnest about learning the sheep business,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; let&#8217;s hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s coming over here today to finish cutting hay.
I&#8217;ll make a deal with him for you to get a band of sheep
to run on shares if you&#8217;ll agree to teach me enough to
get into college&ndash;&ndash;if I&#8217;ve got brains enough to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doubt would be on the side of the teacher, not
the pupil, Miss Sullivan. Maybe your father wouldn&#8217;t
like the arrangement, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll like it, all right. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be very much to my advantage
to take charge of a band of sheep under conditions that
might look as if I needed somebody to plug for me.
Your father might think of me as an incompetent and
good-for-nothing person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid I haven&#8217;t got it in me to learn&ndash;&ndash;you
don&#8217;t want to waste time on me!&#8221; Joan spoke with a
sad bitterness, as one who saw another illusion fading
before her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that,&#8221; he hastened to assure her, putting out
his hand as if to add the comfort of his touch to the
salve of his words. &#8220;I&#8217;m only afraid your father
wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with me if you were to
approach him with any such proposal. From what I&#8217;ve
heard of him he&#8217;s a man who likes a fellow to do his own
talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d refuse me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for a stranger to do that. Your father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not do it, you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d rather get a job from your father on my
own face than on any kind of an arrangement or condition,
Miss Sullivan. But I pass you my word that you&#8217;ll
be welcome to anything and all I&#8217;m able to teach you if
I become a pupil in the sheep business on this range.
Provided, of course, that I&#8217;m in reaching distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; Joan asked, hope clearing the shadows
from her face again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we might be too far apart for lessons very
often,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than ten or twelve miles. I could ride that
every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain then, if I get on,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; nodded Joan, giving him her hand
to bind it, with great earnestness in her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TIM SULLIVAN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they call us flockmasters in the reports of
the Wool Growers&#8217; Association, and in the
papers and magazines, but we&#8217;re nothing but sheepmen,
and that&#8217;s all you can make out of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Sullivan spoke without humor when he made this
correction in the name of his calling, sitting with his
back to a haycock, eating his dinner in the sun. Mackenzie
accepted the correction with a nod of understanding,
sparing his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you want to be a flockmaster?&#8221; said Tim. &#8220;Well,
there&#8217;s worse callin&#8217;s a man, especially a young man,
could take up. What put it in your head to tramp off
up here to see me? Couldn&#8217;t some of them sheepmen
down at Jasper use you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to get into the heart of the sheep country
for one thing, and several of my friends recommended
you as the best sheepman on the range, for another. I
want to learn under a master, if I learn at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Tim nodded, &#8220;right and sound. Do you
think you&#8217;ve got the stuff in you to make a sheepman
out of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will have to be a pretty hard school if I can&#8217;t
stick it through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Summers are all right,&#8221; said Tim, reflectively, nodding
away at the distant hills, &#8220;and falls are all right,
but you take it winter and early spring, and it tries the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
mettle in a man. Blizzards and starvation, and losses
through pile-ups and stampedes, wolves and what not,
make a man think sometimes he&#8217;ll never go through it
any more. Then spring comes, with the cold wind, and
slush up to your ankles, and you out day and night
lookin&#8217; after the ewes and lambs. Lambin&#8217; time is the
hard time, and it&#8217;s the time when a man makes it or
loses, accordin&#8217; to what&#8217;s in him to face hardship and
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about it; I know what I&#8217;m asking to go
up against, Mr. Sullivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to buy in, or take a band on shares?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather take a band on shares. If I put what
little money I&#8217;ve got into it I&#8217;ll go it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; it&#8217;s safer to let the other man take
the risk. It ain&#8217;t fair to us sheepmen, but we have to
do it to get men. Well, when we hit on a good man,
it pays better than hirin&#8217; poor ones at fifty dollars a
month and found. I&#8217;ve had old snoozers workin&#8217; for
me that the coyotes eat the boots off of while they was
asleep. You look kind of slim and light to tackle a
job on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie made no defense of his weight, advancing
no further argument in behalf of his petition for a job.
Sullivan measured him over with his appraising eyes,
saying nothing about the bruises he bore, although
Mackenzie knew he was burning with curiosity to go
into the matter of how and when he received them.</p>
<p>Sullivan was a man of calm benignity of face, a placid
certainty of his power and place in the world; a rugged
man, broad-handed, slow. His pleasure was in the distinction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
of his wealth, and not in any use that he made
of it for his own comfort or the advancement of those
under his hand. Even so, he was of a type superior
to the general run of flockmasters such as Mackenzie
had met.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a job helpin&#8217; me on this hay for a few
days, and kind of try you out,&#8221; Tim agreed at last.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to discourage you at the start, but I don&#8217;t
believe you got the mettle in you to make a flockmaster,
if you want to call it that, out of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll help you on the hay. Before I start
in though, I&#8217;d like to borrow a saddle-horse from you
to take a ride down the creek to Swan Carlson&#8217;s place.
I wouldn&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlson&#8217;s place? Do you know Swan Carlson?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie told in few words how much he knew of
Carlson, and his reason for desiring to visit him. Tim&#8217;s
wonder was too large to contain at hearing this news.
He got up, his eyes staring in plain incredulity, his
mouth open a bit between surprise and censure, it
seemed. But he said nothing for a little while; only
stood and looked Mackenzie over again, with more careful
scrutiny than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down with you,&#8221; he announced, turning
abruptly away to get the horses.</p>
<p>It was evident to Mackenzie that Sullivan was bewildered
between doubt and suspicion as they rode toward
Carlson&#8217;s ranch, which the sheepman said was about
seven miles away. But he betrayed nothing of his
thoughts in words, riding in silence mainly, looking at
the ground like a man who had troubles on his mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>The silence of abandonment was over Carlson&#8217;s house
as they rode up. A few chickens retreated from the
yard to the cover of the barn in the haste of panic, their
going being the only sound of life about the place. The
door through which Mackenzie had left was shut; he
approached it without hesitation&ndash;&ndash;Tim Sullivan lingering
back as if in doubt of their reception&ndash;&ndash;and knocked.
No answer. Mackenzie tried the door, finding it unlocked;
pushed it open, entered.</p>
<p>Sullivan stood outside, one mighty hand on the jamb,
his body to one side under protection of the house, his
head put cautiously and curiously round to see, leaving
a fairway for Swan Carlson should he rise from a dark
corner, shake himself like an old grizzly, and charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he there?&#8221; Tim asked, his voice a strained whisper.</p>
<p>Mackenzie did not reply. He stood in the middle
of the room where his combat with Swan had taken
place, among the debris of broken dishes, wrecked table,
fallen stovepipe and tinware, looking about him with
grim interest. There was nobody in the other room,
but the blood from Swan&#8217;s hurt trailed across the floor
as if he had been helped to the bed. Tim took his
courage in both hands and came just inside the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man! Look at the blood!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody here,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, turning
to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s took him to the doctor,&#8221; said Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kind of a one over on the Sweetwater,
sixty miles from here, but there&#8217;s no good one this side
of Jasper.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll die on the way,&#8221; Mackenzie said conclusively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; said Tim. &#8220;Look! There&#8217;s the
chain he tied that woman of his up with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better go back and get at that hay,&#8221; Mackenzie
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can do for Carlson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the table leg you hit him with!&#8221; Tim picked
it up, plucking off the red hairs which clung to it, looking
at Mackenzie with startled eyes. Mackenzie mounted
his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better shut the door,&#8221; he called back as he
rode away.</p>
<p>Tim caught up with him half a mile on the way back
to the hay-field. The sheepman seemed to have outrun
his words. A long time he rode beside Mackenzie in
silence, turning a furtive eye upon him across his long
nose now and then. At last it burst from him:</p>
<p>&#8220;You done it!&#8221; he said, with the astonished pleasure
of a man assured against his doubts.</p>
<p>Mackenzie checked his horse, looking at Tim in perplexed
inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You laid him out&ndash;&ndash;Swan Carlson&ndash;&ndash;you done it!
Man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re still talking about that,&#8221; Mackenzie said,
a bit vexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be worth thousands to the rest of us sheepmen
on this range if he never comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t some of you handle him long ago? A
man of your build ought to be able to put a dent in
Carlson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight any man that stands on two feet,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Tim, with such sincerity that it could not have been
taken for a boast, &#8220;you can ask about me far and near,
but I draw the line at the devil. I&#8217;ve stood up with
four men against me, with meat cleavers and butcher
knives in their hands, when I used to work as a sheep
butcher back in the packin&#8217; house in Chicago, and I&#8217;ve
come through with my life. But them was friends of
mine,&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;a man knew how they lived. Swan
Carlson&#8217;s got a wolf&#8217;s blood in his veins. He ain&#8217;t a
human man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this man is worth three hundred thousand dollars!&#8221;
thought Mackenzie. And he knew, also, that the
greatest treasure that the flockmaster could count was
one not so greatly appreciated as a thousand sheep&ndash;&ndash;that
brave, ambitious little rebel, Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve got the makin&#8217; of a sheepman in you,&#8221;
Tim said, thoughtfully, as they came in sight of the
hay. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an old man I could put you under till
the dogs got used to you and you learnt their ways and
found out something among the thousand things a man&#8217;s
got to know if he intends to make a success of runnin&#8217;
sheep. Old Dad Frazer could put you onto the tricks
of the trade quicker than any man I know. Maybe
you <i>have</i> got the makin&#8217; of a sheepman in you. I&#8217;ll
have to think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim took the four days they were at the hay to think
about it. At the end of that time, with the hay in
stack and the mowing-machine loaded into the wagon
for the rough journey to the ranch, Tim unburdened
his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to try you out, John,&#8221; he announced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
but shaking his head as he spoke, as if he doubted the
wisdom of the venture. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you here with Dad
Frazer&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s over on Horsethief, about six miles across
from Joan&#8217;s range&ndash;&ndash;and let him break you in. You
understand, you don&#8217;t go in on shares till you&#8217;re able
to handle at least two thousand head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there&#8217;s another little point.&#8221; Tim shifted
his feet, jerked up his trousers, rubbed his chin in a truly
Irish way. &#8220;That girl of mine, Joan, she&#8217;s got it in her
head she wants to be a lady, and go to college and put
on agonies. No use in it, as I tell her. No girl that&#8217;s
got money needs any of the education stuff. I got on
without it, and I made my money without it. Joan she
wants you to give her some lessons. She made me
promise I wouldn&#8217;t take you on unless you&#8217;d agree to
that as part of our conditions and contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie had no need to put on a face of thinking
it over seriously; he was entirely sincere in the silence
he held while he revolved it in his mind. He doubted
whether more learning would bring to Joan the contentment
which she lacked in her present state. It
might only open the door to a greater longing, or it
might disillusion her when her feet had left these wild,
free hills, and set a pang in her heart like a flame for
the things which knowledge closes the door against the
return for evermore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how to handle her to be rid of her soon,&#8221;
said Tim, winking craftily, seeing how the wind stood.
&#8220;Discourage her, tell her she ain&#8217;t got the mind for
books and Latin and mathematics. All the mathematics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
she needs is enough to count her sheep and figure her
clip. Tell her to put books out of her head and stick
to the range, marry some good sheepman if one turns
up to her taste, or pass them all up if she likes. But
tell her to stick to sheep, whatever she does. She can
be the sheep queen of this country in fifteen years; she&#8217;s
as handy with &#8217;em now as I am, and I tell you, John,
that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s hard for me to say, even of my
own girl. But she is; she&#8217;s as good a sheepman right
now as I am or ever will be. But you don&#8217;t need to
tell her that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;ll take it, but it&#8217;s the soundest
advice I could give her,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Work up to it gradual, lad; it can&#8217;t be done in a
day. Make the lessons hard, pile the Latin on heavy.
Lord, I remember it, back in the old country, old Father
MacGuire layin&#8217; it on the lads under his thumb. Devil
a word of it sticks to me now, not even the word for
sheep. I tried to remember some of it when they sent
me up to the legislature in Cheyenne; I wanted to knock
&#8217;em over. But it had all leaked out. Discourage her,
man; discourage her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that might be the greatest kindness I could do
her in the end,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop you off over there; you can stay in camp
tonight with Charley and Joan. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll come
back and take you out to Dad Frazer&#8217;s camp, and you
can begin your schoolin&#8217; for the makin&#8217; of a master.
But begin early to discourage her, John; begin at her
early, lad.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>EYES IN THE FIRELIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;They call it the lonesomeness here,&#8221; said Joan,
her voice weary as with the weight of the day.
&#8220;People shoot themselves when they get it bad&ndash;&ndash;green
sheepherders and farmers that come in here to try to
plow up the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy guys,&#8221; said Charley, contemptuously, chin
in his hands where he stretched full length on his belly
beside the embers of the supper fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homesick,&#8221; said Mackenzie, understandingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard it&#8217;s one of the worst of all diseases. It defeats
armies sometimes, so you can&#8217;t blame a lone sheepherder
if he loses his mind on account of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Charley, no sympathy in him for such
weakness at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; Joan admitted, thoughtfully. &#8220;I was
brought up here, it&#8217;s home to me. Maybe I&#8217;d get the
lonesomeness if I was to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure would, kid,&#8221; said Charley, with comfortable
finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to go, just the same,&#8221; Joan declared, a
certain defiance in her tone, as if in defense of a question
often disputed between herself and Charley.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you do,&#8221; said Charley, &#8220;but you&#8217;d hit the
high places comin&#8217; back home. Ain&#8217;t that right, Mr.
Mackenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s something to it,&#8221; Mackenzie allowed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I would,&#8221; Joan yielded, &#8220;but as soon as my
share in the sheep figures up enough you&#8217;ll see me hittin&#8217;
the breeze for Chicago. I want to see the picture
galleries and libraries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go through the mail-order house we get
our things from up there,&#8221; Charley said. &#8220;The catalogue
says it covers seventeen acres!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was camping with them for the night on
his way to Dad Frazer&#8217;s range, according to Tim Sullivan&#8217;s
plan. Long since they had finished supper; the
sheep were quiet below them on the hillside. The silence
of the sheeplands, almost oppressive in its weight, lay
around them so complete and unbroken that Mackenzie
fancied he could hear the stars snap as they sparkled.
He smiled to himself at the fancy, face turned up to the
deep serenity of the heavens. Charley blew the embers,
stirring them with a brush of sage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lonesomeness,&#8221; said Mackenzie, with a curious
dwelling on the word; &#8220;I never heard it used in that
specific sense before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it sure gets a greenhorn,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>Charley held the sage-branch to the embers, blowing
them until a little blaze jumped up into the startled
dark. The sudden light revealed Joan&#8217;s face where she
sat across from Mackenzie, and it was so pensively sad
that it smote his heart like a pain to see.</p>
<p>Her eyes stood wide open as she had stretched them
to roam into the night after her dreams of freedom
beyond the land she knew, and so she held them a
moment, undazzled by the light of the leaping blaze.
They gleamed like glad waters in a morning sun, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the schoolmaster&#8217;s heart was quickened by them, and
the pain for her longing soothed out of it. The well
of her youth was revealed before him, the fountain of
her soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to roll in,&#8221; Charley announced, his branch
consumed in the eager breath of the little blaze. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
slam your shoes down like you was drivin&#8217; nails when
you come in, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t bother you much,&#8221; Joan told him, calmly
indifferent to his great desire for unbroken repose.</p>
<p>Charley rolled on his back, where he lay a little while
in luxurious inaction, sleep coming over him heavily.
Joan shook him, sending him stumbling off to the wagon
and his bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could drive a wagon over him and never wake
him once he hits the hay,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a man is Dad Frazer?&#8221; Mackenzie
asked, his mind running on his business adventure that
was to begin on the morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a regular old flat-foot,&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
talk your leg off before you&#8217;ve been around him a week,
blowin&#8217; about what he used to do down in Oklahoma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a man couldn&#8217;t get the lonesomeness around
him, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get it, all right, just like I told you; no
green hand with all his senses ever escaped it. Maybe
you&#8217;ll have it light, though,&#8221; she added, hopefully, as if
to hold him up for the ordeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. But with you coming over to take lessons,
and Dad Frazer talking morning, noon, and night,
I&#8217;ll forget Egypt and its fleshpots, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Egypt? I thought you came from Jasper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a saying, used in relation to the place you
look back to with regret when you&#8217;re hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so ignorant I ought to be shot!&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>And Mackenzie sat silently fronting her, the dead
fire between, a long time, thinking of the sparkle of
her yearning eyes, smiling in his grim way to himself
when there was no chance of being seen as he felt again
the flash of them strike deep into his heart. Wise eyes,
eyes which held a store of wholesome knowledge gleaned
from the years in those silent places where her soul had
grown without a shadow to smirch its purity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between wisdom and learning,&#8221;
he said at last, in low and thoughtful voice. &#8220;What&#8217;s
it like over where Dad Frazer grazes his sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Close to the range Swan Carlson and the Hall boys
use, and you want to keep away from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; I wouldn&#8217;t want to trespass on anybody&#8217;s
territory. Are they all disagreeable people over that
way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody there but the Halls and Carlson.
You know Swan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might improve on close acquaintance,&#8221; Mackenzie
speculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s as bad as the Halls, wild and
crazy as he is. Hector Hall, especially. But you may
get on with them, all right&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want to throw any
scare into you before you meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they out looking for trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as they are, but they&#8217;re there to make
it if anybody lets a sheep get an inch over the line they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
claim as theirs. Oh, well, pass &#8217;em up till you have to
meet them&ndash;&ndash;maybe they&#8217;ll treat you white, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again a silence stood between them, Mackenzie considering
many things, not the least of them being this
remarkable girl&#8217;s life among the sheep and the rough
characters of the range, no wonder in him over her
impatience to be away from it. It seemed to him that
Tim Sullivan might well spare her the money for schooling,
as well as fend her against the dangers and hardships
of the range by keeping her at home these summer
days.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks to me like a hard life for a girl,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;no diversions, none of the things that youth generally
values and craves. Don&#8217;t you ever have any dances or
anything&ndash;&ndash;camp meetings or picnics?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have dances over at Four Corners sometimes&ndash;&ndash;Hector
Hall wanted me to go to one with him about a
year ago. He had his nerve to ask me, the little old
sheep-thief!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been doubly sore at us ever since I turned him
down. I looked for him to come over and shoot up my
camp some night for a long time, but I guess he isn&#8217;t
that bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much to his credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wish sometimes I&#8217;d gone with him. Maybe it
would have straightened things out. You know, when
you stay here on the range, Mr. Mackenzie, you&#8217;re on
a level with everybody else, no matter what you think
of yourself. You can&#8217;t get out of the place they make
for you in their estimation of you. Hector Hall never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
will believe I&#8217;m too good to go to a dance with him.
He&#8217;ll be sore about it all his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man naturally would have regrets, Miss Sullivan.
Maybe that&#8217;s as far as it goes with Hector Hall, maybe
he&#8217;s only sore at heart for the honor denied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t sound like real talk,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>Mackenzie grinned at the rebuke, and the candor and
frankness in which it was administered, thinking that
Joan would have a frigid time of it out in the world if
she applied such outspoken rules to its flatteries and
mild humbugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be natural then,&#8221; he suggested, considering as
he spoke that candor was Joan&#8217;s best defense in her
position on the range. Here she sat out under the
stars with him, miles from the nearest habitation, miles
from her father&#8217;s house, her small protector asleep in
the wagon, and thought no more of it than a chaperoned
daughter of the city in an illuminated drawing-room.
A girl had to put men in their places and keep them
there under such circumstances, and nobody knew better
how to do it than Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try your patience and good humor when you
start out to teach me,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;for I&#8217;ll want to
run before I learn to walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see how it goes in a few days; I&#8217;ve sent for
the books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a good many wild breaks,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
tumble around a lot, I know, but there won&#8217;t be anybody
to laugh at me&ndash;&ndash;but you.&#8221; She paused as if considering
the figure she would make at the tasks she awaited
with such impatience, then added under her breath,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
almost in a whisper, as if it was not meant for him to
hear: &#8220;But you&#8217;ll never laugh at me for being hungry
to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie attempted neither comment nor reply to
this, feeling that it was Joan&#8217;s heart speaking to herself
alone. He looked away over the sleeping sheeplands,
vast as the sea, and as mysterious under the starlight,
thinking that it would require more than hard
lessons and unusual tasks to discourage this girl. She
stood at the fountain-edge, leaning with dry lips to
drink, her wistful eyes strong to probe the mysteries
which lay locked in books yet strange to her, but wiser
in her years than many a man who had skimmed a college
course. There was a vast difference between knowledge
and learning, indeed; it never had been so apparent
to him as in the presence of that outspoken girl of the
sheep range that summer night.</p>
<p>What would the world do with Joan Sullivan if she
ever broke her fetters and went to it? How would it
accept her faith and frankness, her high scorn for the
deceits upon which it fed? Not kindly, he knew. There
would be disillusionment ahead for her, and bitter awakening
from long-wrapping dreams. If he could teach
her to be content in the wide freedom of that place he
would accomplish the greatest service that he could
bring her in the days of her untroubled youth. Discourage
her, said Tim Sullivan. Mackenzie felt that
this was not his job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Charley&#8217;s right about it,&#8221; she said, her voice
low, and soft with that inherited gentleness which must
have come from Tim Sullivan&#8217;s mother, Mackenzie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
thought. &#8220;He&#8217;s a wise kid, maybe I would want to
come back faster than I went away. But I get so
tired of it sometimes I walk up and down out here by
the wagon half the night, and wear myself out making
plans that I may never be able to put through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as well,&#8221; he told her, nodding again in his
solemn, weighty fashion; &#8220;everybody that amounts to
anything has this fever of unrest. Back home we used
to stack the wheat to let it sweat and harden. You&#8217;re
going through that. It takes the grossness out of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you gone through it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Years of it; over the worst of it now, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you came here. Was that the kind of an
ambition you had? Was that all your dreams brought
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve seen more here than I ever projected in
my schemes, Miss Joan. I&#8217;ve seen the serenity of the
stars in this vastness; I&#8217;ve felt the wind of freedom on
my face.&#8221; And to himself: &#8220;And I have seen the firelight
leap in a maiden&#8217;s eyes, and I have looked deep
into the inspiring fountain of her soul.&#8221; But there
was not the boldness in him, nor the desire to risk her
rebuke again, to bring it to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ll like it after you get over the
lonesomeness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if I take the lonesomeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take it, all right. But if you ever do work
up to be a sheepman, and of course you will if you
stick to the range long enough, you&#8217;ll never be able to
leave again. Sheep tie a person down like a houseful
of children.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d never want to go. I&#8217;ve had my turn at
it out there; I&#8217;ve been snubbed and discounted, all but
despised, because I had a little learning and no money
to go with it. I can hide my little learning here, and
nobody seems to care about the money. Yes, I think
I&#8217;ll stay on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan turned her face away, and he knew the yearning
was in her eyes as they strained into the starlit
horizon after the things she had never known.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what could ever happen that would make
me want to stay here,&#8221; she said at last. She got up with
the sudden nimbleness of a deer, so quickly that Mackenzie
though she must be either startled or offended,
but saw in a moment it was only her natural way of
moving in the untrammeled freedom of her lithe, strong
limbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find a soft place on the side of the hill somewhere
to sleep,&#8221; she said, turning toward the wagon.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to pile in. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat again by the ashes of the little fire
after giving her good night. He felt that he had
suffered in her estimation because of his lowly ambition
to follow her father, and the hundred other obscure
heroes of the sheep country, and become a flockmaster,
sequestered and safe among the sage-gray hills.</p>
<p>Joan expected more of a man who was able to teach
school; expected lofty aims, far-reaching ambitions.
But that was because Joan did not know the world that
lifted the lure of its flare beyond the rim of her horizon.
She must taste it to understand, and come back with
a bruised heart to the shelter of her native hills.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>And this lonesomeness of which she had been telling
him, this dread sickness that fell upon a man in those
solitudes, and drained away his courage and hope&ndash;&ndash;must
he experience it, like a disease of adolescence from which
few escape? He did not believe it. Joan had said she
was immune to it, having been born in its atmosphere,
knowing nothing but solitude and silence, in which there
was no strange nor fearful thing.</p>
<p>But she fretted under a discontent that made her
miserable, even though it did not strain her reason like
the lonesomeness. Something was wanting to fill her
life. He cast about him, wondering what it could be,
wishing that he might supply it and take away the
shadow out of her eyes.</p>
<p>It was his last thought as he fell asleep in a little
swale below the wagon where the grass was tall and
soft&ndash;&ndash;that he might find what was lacking to make Joan
content with the peace and plenty of the sheeplands,
and supply that want.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE EASIEST LESSON</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Why do they always begin the conjugations on
<i>love</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no perplexity in Joan&#8217;s eyes as she asked
the question; rather, a dreamy and far-away look, the
open book face-downward on the ground beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a good example of the first termination,
I suppose,&#8221; Mackenzie replied, his eyes measuring off
the leagues with her own, as if they together sought the
door that opened out of that gray land into romance
that quiet summer afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was that way in the Spanish grammar,&#8221; said
Joan, shaking her head, unconvinced by the reason he
advanced. &#8220;There are plenty of words in the first termination
that are just as short. Why? You&#8217;re the
teacher; you ought to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said it banteringly, as if she dared him to give
the reason. His eyes came back from their distant
groping, meeting hers with gentle boldness. So for a
little while he looked silently into her appealing eyes,
then turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, Joan, because it is the easiest lesson to learn
and the hardest to forget,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Joan bent her gaze upon the ground, a flush tinting
her brown face, plucking at the grass with aimless
fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, we&#8217;ve passed it,&#8221; said she.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, it recurs all through the book; it&#8217;s something
that can&#8217;t be left out of it, any more than it can be
left out of life. Well, it doesn&#8217;t need to trouble you
and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we could use some other word,&#8221; said Joan, turning
her face away.</p>
<p>&#8220;But mean the same, Joan. I had an old maid English
teacher when I was a boy who made us conjugate <i>to
like</i> instead of the more intimate and tender word. Poor
old soul! I hope it saved her feelings and eased her
regrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;d had a romance,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so; there&#8217;s at least one romance coming to
every woman in this world. If she misses it she&#8217;s being
cheated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie took up the Latin grammar, marking off
her next lesson, and piling it on with unsparing hand,
too. Yet not in accord with Tim Sullivan&#8217;s advice;
solely because his pupil was one of extraordinary capacity.
There was no such thing as discouraging Joan;
she absorbed learning and retained it, as the sandstone
absorbs oil under the pressure of the earth, holding it
without wasting a drop until the day it gladdens man in
his exploration.</p>
<p>So with Joan. She was storing learning in the undefiled
reservoir of her mind, to be found like unexpected
jewels by some hand in after time. As she followed the
sheep she carried her books; at night, long after Charley
had gone to sleep, she sat with them by the lantern
light in the sheep-wagon. Unspoiled by the diversions
and distractions which divide the mind of the city student,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
she acquired and held a month&#8217;s tasks in a week.
The thirsty traveler in the desert places had come to
the oasis of her dreams.</p>
<p>Daily Joan rode to the sheep-camp where Mackenzie
was learning the business of running sheep under Dad
Frazer. There were no holidays in the term Joan had
set for herself, no unbending, no relaxation from her
books. Perhaps she did not expect her teacher to
remain there in the sheeplands, shut away from the life
that he had breathed so long and put aside for what
seemed to her an unaccountable whim.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be reading Caesar by winter,&#8221; Mackenzie told
her as she prepared to ride back to her camp. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to take it slower then; we can&#8217;t have lessons every
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; She was standing beside her horse, hat
in hand, her rich hair lifting in the wind from her wise,
placid brow. Her books she had strapped to the saddle-horn;
there was a yellow slicker at the cantle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be at home, I&#8217;ll be out here with the sheep.
I expect about once a week will be as often as we can
make it then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be out here on the range,&#8221; she said, shaking her
determined head, &#8220;a sheepman&#8217;s got to stick with his
flock through all kinds of weather. If I run home for
the winter I&#8217;ll have to hire a herder, and that would eat
my profits up; I&#8217;d never get away from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe by the time you&#8217;ve got enough money to
carry out your plans, Joan, you&#8217;ll not want to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have education to be able to enjoy
money. Some of the sheepmen in this country&ndash;&ndash;yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
most of them&ndash;&ndash;would be better men if they were poor.
Wealth is nothing to them but a dim consciousness of
a new power. It makes them arrogant and unbearable.
Did you ever see Matt Hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still have that pleasure in reserve. But I think
you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s refinement, rather than learning, that
a person needs to enjoy wealth. That comes more
from within than without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The curtain&#8217;s down between me and everything I
want,&#8221; Joan said, a wistful note of loneliness in her
low, soft voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ride away some day and
push it aside, and see what it&#8217;s been keeping from me
all the years of my longing. Then, maybe, when I&#8217;m
satisfied I&#8217;ll come back and make money. I&#8217;ve got sense
enough to see it&#8217;s here to be made if a person&#8217;s got the
sheep to start with and the range to run them on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll have to go,&#8221; said he, in what seemed sad
thoughtfulness, &#8220;to learn it all; I can&#8217;t teach you the
things your heart desires most to know. Well, there are
bitter waters and sweet waters, Joan; we&#8217;ve got to
drink them both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same way here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;only we&#8217;ve got
sense enough to know the alkali holes before we drink
out of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But people are not that wise the world over, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan stood in silent thought, her far-reaching gaze
on the dim curtain of haze which hung between her and
the world of men&#8217;s activities, strivings, and lamentations.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had the money I&#8217;d go as soon&ndash;&ndash;as soon as I
knew a little more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to stick;
I made that bargain with dad&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d never give me the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
money, but he&#8217;ll buy me out when I&#8217;ve got enough to
stake me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father was over this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks <i>my</i> education&#8217;s advanced far enough to
trust me with a band of sheep. I&#8217;m going to have charge
of the flock I&#8217;ve been running here with Dad Frazer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t congratulate me on becoming a paid
sheepherder, my first step on the way to flockmaster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re to be congratulated,&#8221; she
returned, facing him seriously. &#8220;All there is to success
here is brute strength and endurance against storms
and winter weather&ndash;&ndash;it don&#8217;t take any brains. Out
there where you&#8217;ve been and I&#8217;m going, there must be
something bigger and better for a man, it seems to me.
But maybe men get tired of it&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll understand it better when you go there, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll understand a lot of things that are locked
up to me now. Well, I don&#8217;t want to go as much all
the time now as I did&ndash;&ndash;only in spells sometimes. If you
stay here and teach me, maybe I&#8217;ll get over it for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan laughed nervously, half of it forced, her face
averted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could teach you enough to keep you here, Joan,
I&#8217;d think it was the biggest thing I&#8217;d ever done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know any more if it means giving
up,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like giving up to you, Joan, but I&#8217;ve only
started,&#8221; he corrected her, in gentle spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t talk that way to you,&#8221; she said, turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
to him contritely, her earnest eyes lifted to his, &#8220;it&#8217;s
none of my business what you do. If you hadn&#8217;t come
here I&#8217;d never have heard of&ndash;&ndash;of <i>amare</i>, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan bent her head, a flush over her brown cheeks, a
smile of mischief at the corners of her mouth. Mackenzie
laughed, but strained and unnaturally, his own tough
face burning with a hot tide of mounting blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody else would have taught you&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;d have
conjugated it in another language, maybe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you say it&#8217;s the easiest lesson to learn,&#8221; she
nodded, soberly now. &#8220;Have you taught it to many&ndash;&ndash;many&ndash;&ndash;girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the book, Joan,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;only
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan drew a deep breath, and looked away over the
hills, and smiled. But she said no more, after the way
of one who has relieved the mind on a doubted point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect I&#8217;ll be getting a taste of the lonesomeness
here of nights pretty soon,&#8221; Mackenzie said, feeling himself
in an awkward, yet not unpleasant situation with
this frank girl&#8217;s rather impertinent question still burning
in his heart. &#8220;Dad&#8217;s going to leave me to take
charge of another flock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to keep you so busy you&#8217;ll not have it very
bad,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;ll pump your fount of knowledge dry
in a hurry if you don&#8217;t slow down a little,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;At the pace you&#8217;ve set you&#8217;ll have to import a professor
to take you along, unless one strays in from somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take up with strays,&#8221; said Joan, rather
loftily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think Dad&#8217;s getting restless,&#8221; Mackenzie said,
hastening to cover his mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;He goes away every so often,&#8221; Joan explained, &#8220;to
see his Mexican wife down around El Paso somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that explains it. He didn&#8217;t mention her to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will, all right. He&#8217;ll cut out to see her in a
little while, more than likely, but he&#8217;ll come drifting
back with the shearers in the spring like he always does.
It seems to me like everybody comes back to the sheep
country that&#8217;s ever lived in it a while. I wonder if I&#8217;d
want to come back, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a speculation upon which Mackenzie did not
feel called to make comment. Time alone would prove
to Joan where her heart lay anchored, as it proves to
all who go wandering in its own bitter way at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to want to go away as long as I&#8217;m
learning something,&#8221; Joan confessed, a little ashamed
of the admission, it appeared, from her manner of refusing
to lift her head.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt a great uplifting in his heart, as a
song cheers it when it comes gladly at the close of a
day of perplexity and doubt and toil. He reached out
his hand as if to touch her and tell her how this dawning
of his hope made him glad, but withdrew it, dropping
it at his side as she looked up, a lively color in her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you&#8217;ll stay and teach me, there isn&#8217;t any
particular use for me to leave, is there?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;If staying here would keep you, Joan, I&#8217;d never
leave,&#8221; he told her, his voice so grave and earnest that
it trembled a little on the low notes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>Joan drew her breath again with that long inspiration
which was like a satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must go,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But she did not move, and Mackenzie, drawing nearer,
put out his hand in his way of silent appeal again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I don&#8217;t want you to know what there is out
there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but because I&#8217;d save you the disappointment,
the disillusionment, and the heartache that
too often go with the knowledge of the world. You&#8217;d
be better for it if you never knew, living here undefiled
like a spring that comes out of the rocks into the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must go,&#8221; said Joan, sighing with repletion
again, but taking no step toward her waiting horse.</p>
<p>Although it was a moment which seemed full of things
to be said, neither had words for it, but stood silently
while the day went out in glory around them. Dad
Frazer was bringing his murmuring flock home to the
bedding-ground on the hillside below the wagon; the
wind was low as a lover&#8217;s breath, lifting Joan&#8217;s russet
hair from her pure, placid brow.</p>
<p>And she must go at last, with a word of parting from
the saddle, and her hand held out to him in a new tenderness
as if going home were a thing to be remembered.
And as Mackenzie took it there rose in his memory the
lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Touch hands and part with laughter,<br />
Touch lips and part with tears.</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Joan rode away against the sun, which was red upon
the hill, and stood for a little moment sharply against
the fiery sky to wave him a farewell.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So easily learned, Joan; so hard to forget,&#8221; said
Mackenzie, speaking as if he sent his voice after her, a
whisper on the wind, although she was half a mile away.
A moment more, and the hill stood empty between them.
Mackenzie turned to prepare supper for the coming
of Dad Frazer, who would complain against books and
the nonsense contained in them if the food was not on
the board when he came up the hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE SHEEP-KILLER</h3>
</div>
<p>It was dusk when Dad Frazer drove the slow-drifting
flock home to its sleeping place, which tomorrow
night very likely would be on some hillside no softer,
many miles away. Only a few days together the camp
remained in one place, no longer than it took the sheep
to crop the herbage within easy reach. Then came the
camp-mover and hauled the wagon to fresh pastures in
that illimitable, gray-green land.</p>
<p>Dad Frazer was a man of sixty or sixty-five, who had
been an army teamster in the days of frontier posts.
He was slender and sinewy, with beautiful, glimmering,
silvery hair which he wore in long curls and kept as
carefully combed as any dandy that ever pranced at
the court of a king. It was his one vanity, his dusty,
greasy raiment being his last thought.</p>
<p>Dad&#8217;s somber face was brown and weathered, marked
with deep lines, covered over with an ashy, short growth
of beard which he clipped once in two weeks with sheep-shears
when he didn&#8217;t lose count of the days.</p>
<p>Frazer always wore an ancient military hat with a
leather thong at the back of his head drawn tight across
his flowing hair. The brim of this hat turned up in the
back as if he had slept in it many years, which was
indeed the case, and down in the front so low over his
brows that it gave him a sullen and clouded cast, which
the redundancy of his spirits and words at once denied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>For Dad Frazer was a loquacious sheepherder, an
exception among the morose and silent men who follow
that isolated calling upon the lonely range. He talked
to the dogs when there was nobody by, to the sheep as
he scattered them for an even chance between weak and
strong over the grazing lands, and to himself when no
other object presented. He swore with force and
piquancy, and original embellishments for old-time oaths
which was like a sharp sauce to an unsavory dish.</p>
<p>Frazer was peculiar in another way. He liked a
soft bed to pound the ground on after his long days
after the sheep, and to that end kept a roll of sheepskins
under the wagon. More than that, he always
washed before eating, even if he had to divide the last
water in the keg.</p>
<p>Now as he was employed with his ablutions, after
a running fire of talk from the time he came within
hearing to the moment the water smothered his voice
over the basin, Mackenzie saw him turn an eye in his
direction every little while between the soaping and the
washing of his bearded face. The old fellow seemed
bursting with restraint of something that he had not
told or asked about. Mackenzie could read him like a
thermometer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Dad&ndash;&ndash;rattlesnakes?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rattlesnakes nothin&#8217;!&#8221; returned the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought another one had been crawling up your
leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearer boey constructors! Anybody been here but
Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Dad came over to the tail of the wagon, where Mackenzie
had supper spread on a board, a box at each
end, for that was a sheep-camp <i>de luxe</i>. He stood a
little while looking about in the gloom, his head tipped
as if he listened, presently taking his place, unaccountably
silent, and uncomfortably so, as Mackenzie could
very well see.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t lose a dog, did you, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog nothin&#8217;! Do I look like a man that&#8217;d lose a
dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dad,&#8221; Mackenzie said, in his slow, thoughtful
way, &#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know how a man that would lose
a dog looks, but I don&#8217;t believe you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan Carlson&#8217;s back on the range!&#8221; said Dad, delivering
it before he was ready, perhaps, and before he
had fully prepared the way, but unable to hold it a
second longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan Carlson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they fixed him up in the hospital at Cheyenne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon they must &#8217;a&#8217;. He&#8217;s back runnin&#8217; his sheep,
and that woman of his&#8217;n she&#8217;s with him. Swan run one
of his herders off the first rattle out of the box, said
he&#8217;d been stealin&#8217; sheep while he was gone. That&#8217;s one
of his old tricks to keep from payin&#8217; a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like him, all right. Have you seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Matt Hall come by this evenin&#8217;, and told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Swan got all right again, anyhow, even
if he&#8217;s no better to his wife than he was before. I was
kind of worried about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s meaner than he ever was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
knockin&#8217; that woman around like a sack of sawdust the
way he always did. I reckon he gets more fun out of
her that way than he does keepin&#8217; her tied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can hang her for all I&#8217;ll ever interfere between
them again, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It don&#8217;t pay to shove in between a
man and his wife in their fusses and disturbances. I
know a colonel in the army that&#8217;s got seventeen stitches
in his bay winder right now from buttin&#8217; in between a
captain and his woman. The lady she slid a razor over
his vest. They&#8217;ll do it every time; it&#8217;s woman nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a man of experience, Dad. Well, I
don&#8217;t know much about &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been marryin&#8217; &#8217;em off and on for forty
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Matt Hall, and where&#8217;s his ranch, Dad? I&#8217;ve
been hearing about him and his brother, Hector, ever
since I came up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them Hall boys used to be cattlemen up on the
Sweetwater, but they was run out of there on account
of suspicion of rustlin&#8217;, I hear. They come down to
this country about four years ago and started up sheep,
usin&#8217; on Cottonwood about nine or twelve miles southeast
from here. Them fellers don&#8217;t hitch up with nobody
on this range but Swan Carlson, and I reckon
Swan only respects &#8217;em because they&#8217;re the only men
in this country that packs guns regular any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan don&#8217;t pack a gun as a regular thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never seen him with one on. Hector Hall
he&#8217;s always got a couple of &#8217;em on him, and Matt
mostly has one in sight. You can gamble on it he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
got an automatic in his pocket when he don&#8217;t strap it
on him in the open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what use a man&#8217;s got for a gun up here
among sheep and sheepmen. They must be expecting
somebody to call on them from the old neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I figger that&#8217;s about the size of it. I don&#8217;t
know what Matt was doin&#8217; over around here this evenin&#8217;;
I know I didn&#8217;t send for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan spoke of him this afternoon. From what she
said, I thought he must be something of a specimen.
What kind of a looking duck is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt&#8217;s a mixture of a goriller and a goose egg.
He&#8217;s a long-armed, short-legged, gimlet-eyed feller with
a head like a egg upside down. You could split a board
on that feller&#8217;s head and never muss a hair. I never
saw a man that had a chin like Matt Hall. They say
a big chin&#8217;s the sign of strength, and if that works out
Matt must have a mind like a brigadier general. His
face is all chin; chin&#8217;s an affliction on Matt Hall; it&#8217;s a
disease. Wait till you see him; that&#8217;s all I can say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know him when I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector ain&#8217;t so bad, but he&#8217;s got a look in his eyes
like a man that&#8217;d grab you by the nose and cut your
throat, and grin while he was doin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie made no comment on these new and picturesque
characters introduced by Dad into the drama that
was forming for enactment in that place. He filled his
pipe and smoked a little while. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;How many sheep do they run?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine or ten thousand, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence again. Dad was smoking a little Mexican
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
cigarette with corn-husk wrapper, a peppery tobacco
filling that smarted the eyes when it burned, of which he
must have carried thousands when he left the border in
the spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim was over today,&#8221; said Mackenzie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About this business between him and me. Is it usual,
Dad, for a man to work a year at forty dollars a month
and found before he goes in as a partner on the increase
of the flock he runs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you ask me that, John?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only because there wasn&#8217;t anything said about it
when I agreed with Tim to go to work here with you
and learn the rudiments of handling a band of sheep.
He sprung that on me today, when I thought I was
about to begin my career as a capitalist. Instead of
that, I&#8217;ve got a year ahead of me at ten dollars a month
less than the ordinary herder gets. I just wanted to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheepmen are like sand under the feet when it comes
to dealin&#8217; with &#8217;em; I never knew one that was in the
same place twice. You&#8217;ve got a lot of tricks to learn in
this trade, and I guess this is one of them. I don&#8217;t
believe Tim ever intends to let you in on shares; that
ain&#8217;t his style. Never did take anybody in on shares but
Joan, that I know of. It looks to me like Tim&#8217;s workin&#8217;
you for all he can git out of you. You&#8217;ll herd for Tim
a year at forty dollars, and teach Joan a thousand
dollars&#8217; worth while you&#8217;re doin&#8217; it. You&#8217;re a mighty
obligin&#8217; feller, it looks like to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat thinking it over. He rolled it in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
mind quite a while, considering its most unlikely side,
considering it as a question of comparative values, trying
to convince himself that, if nothing more came of it
than a year&#8217;s employment, he would be even better off
than teaching school. If Tim was indeed planning to
profit doubly by him during that year, Joan could have
no knowledge of his scheme, he was sure.</p>
<p>On Joan&#8217;s account he would remain, he told himself,
at last, feeling easier and less simple for the decision.
Joan needed him, she counted on him. Going would be
a sad disappointment, a bitter discouragement, to her.
All on Joan&#8217;s account, of course, he would remain; Joan,
with her russet hair, the purity of October skies in her
eyes. Why, of course. Duty made it plain to him;
solely on account of Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be a foot-loose shearer, herdin&#8217; in between
like I do, than the richest sheepman on the range,&#8221; said
Dad. &#8220;They&#8217;re tied down to one little spot; they work
out a hole in their piece of the earth like a worm. It
ain&#8217;t no life. I can have more fun on forty dollars than
Tim Sullivan can out of forty thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad got out his greasy duck coat with sheepskin collar,
such as cattlemen and sheepmen, and all kinds of
outdoor men in that country wore, for the night was
cool and damp with dew. Together they sat smoking,
no more discussion between them, the dogs out of sight
down the hill near the sheep.</p>
<p>Not a sound came out of the sheep, bedded on the
hillside in contentment, secure in their trust of men
and dogs. All day as they grazed there rose a murmur
out of them, as of discontent, complaint, or pain. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
their quavering, pathetic voices were as still as the wind.
There was not a shuffle of hoof, not a sigh.</p>
<p>Mackenzie thought of Joan, and the influence this
solitary life, these night silences, had borne in shading
her character with the melancholy which was so plainly
apparent in her longing to be away. She yearned for
the sound of life, for the warmth of youth&#8217;s eager fire
beyond the dusty gray loneliness of this sequestered
place. Still, this was what men and women in the
crowded places thought of and longed toward as freedom.
Loose-footed here upon the hills, one might pass
as free as the wind, indeed, but there was something like
the pain of prison isolation in these night silences which
bore down upon a man and made him old.</p>
<p>A sudden commotion among the sheep, terrified bleating,
quick scurrying of feet, shook Mackenzie out of his
reflections. The dogs charged down the hill and stood
baying the disturber of the flock with savage alarm, in
which there was a note of fear. Dad stood a moment
listening, then reached into the wagon for the rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go down there!&#8221; he warned Mackenzie, who
was running toward the center of disturbance. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a grizzly&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you hear them dogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie stopped. The advance stampede of the
terrified flock rushed past him, dim in the deeper darkness
near the ground. Below on the hillside where the
sheep bedded he could see nothing. Dad came up with
the gun.</p>
<p>The sheep were making no outcry now, and scarcely
any sound of movement. After their first startled break
they had bunched, and were standing in their way of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
pathetic, paralyzing fear, waiting what might befall.
Dad fired several quick shots toward the spot where the
dogs were charging and retreating, voices thick in their
throats from their bristling terror of the thing that had
come to lay tribute upon the flock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go down there!&#8221; Dad cautioned again. &#8220;Git
the lantern and light it&ndash;&ndash;maybe when he sees it he&#8217;ll
run. It&#8217;s a grizzly. I didn&#8217;t think there was one in
forty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie took hold of the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me&ndash;&ndash;hand me another clip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad yielded it, warning Mackenzie again against any
rash movement. But his words were unheeded if not
unheard. Mackenzie was running down the hillside
toward the dogs. Encouraged by his coming, they
dashed forward, Mackenzie halting to peer into the
darkness ahead. There was a sound of trampling, a
crunching as of the rending of bones. He fired; ran a
little nearer, fired again.</p>
<p>The dogs were pushing ahead now in pursuit of whatever
it was that fled. A moment, and Mackenzie heard
the quick break of a galloping horse; fired his remaining
shots after it, and called Dad to fetch the light.</p>
<p>When the horse started, the dogs returned to the
flock, too wise to waste energy in a vain pursuit. At a
word from Mackenzie they began collecting the shuddering
sheep. Dad Frazer came bobbing down the hill
with the lantern, breathing loud in his excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said he, when he saw the havoc his light
revealed; &#8220;a regular old murderin&#8217; stock-killer. And
I didn&#8217;t think there was any grizzly in forty miles.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie took the lantern, sweeping its light over
the mangled bodies of several sheep, torn limb from
limb, scattered about as if they had been the center of
an explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;A murderin&#8217; old stock-killer!&#8221; said Dad, panting,
out of breath.</p>
<p>Mackenzie held up the light, looking the old man in
the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;A grizzly don&#8217;t hop a horse and lope off, and I
never met one yet that wore boots,&#8221; said he. He swung
the light near the ground again, pointing to the trampled
footprints among the mangled carcasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a man!&#8221; said Dad, in terrified amazement.
&#8220;Tore &#8217;em apart like they was rabbits!&#8221; He looked up,
his weathered face white, his eyes staring. &#8220;It takes&ndash;&ndash;it
takes&ndash;&ndash;Lord! Do you know how much muscle it takes
to tear a sheep up that a-way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie did not reply. He stood, turning a bloody
heap of wool and torn flesh with his foot, stunned by
this unexampled excess of human ferocity.</p>
<p>Dad recovered from his amazement presently, bent
and studied the trampled ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Them looks like man&#8217;s
tracks, but a grizzly&#8217;s got a foot like a nigger, and one
of them big fellers makes a noise like a lopin&#8217; horse
when he tears off through the bresh. I tell you, John,
no human man that ever lived could take a live sheep
and tear it up that a-way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then; it was a bear,&#8221; Mackenzie said, not
disposed to argue the matter, for argument would not
change what he knew to be a fact, nor yet convince Dad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Frazer against his reason and experience. But Mackenzie
knew that they were the footprints of a man, and
that the noise of the creature running away from camp
was the noise of a galloping horse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A TWO-GUN MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You know, John, if a man&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a sheepman,
John, he&#8217;s got to keep awake day and
night. He ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to set gabbin&#8217; and let a grizzly
come right up under his nose and kill his sheep. It&#8217;s
the difference between the man that wouldn&#8217;t do it and
the man that would that makes the difference between
a master and a man. That&#8217;s the difference that stands
against Dad Frazer. He&#8217;d never work up to partnership
in a band of sheep if he lived seven hundred years.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tim Sullivan, a few days after the raid on John
Mackenzie&#8217;s flock. He had come over on hearing of it
from Dad Frazer, who had gone to take charge of
another band. Tim was out of humor over the loss,
small as it was out of the thousands he numbered in
his flocks. He concealed his feelings as well as he could
under a friendly face, but his words were hard, the
accusation and rebuke in them sharp.</p>
<p>Mackenzie flared up at the raking-over Tim gave
him, and turned his face away to hold down a hot reply.
Only after a struggle he composed himself to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it was because you saw the same difference
in me that you welched on your agreement to put me in
a partner on the increase of this flock as soon as Dad
taught me how to work the sheep and handle the dogs,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s an easy way for a man to slide out
from under his obligations; it would apply anywhere in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
life as well as in the sheep business. I tell you now I
don&#8217;t think it was square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, lad, I don&#8217;t want you to look at it that way,
not at all, not at all, lad.&#8221; Tim was as gentle as oil
in his front now, afraid that he was in the way of losing
a good herder whom he had tricked into working at a
bargain price. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you understand the lay
of it, if you&#8217;ve got the impression I intended to take
you in at the jump-off, John. It&#8217;s never done; it&#8217;s
never heard of. A man&#8217;s got to prove himself, like
David of old. There&#8217;s a lot of Goliaths here on the
range he&#8217;s got to meet and show he&#8217;s able to handle
before any man would trust him full shares on the
increase of two thousand sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t talk that way at first,&#8221; Mackenzie
charged, rather sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took to you when I heard how you laid Swan out
in that fight you had with him, John. That was a
recommendation. But it wasn&#8217;t enough, for it was
nothing but a chance lucky blow you got in on him that
give you the decision. If you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; missed him, where
would you &#8217;a&#8217; been at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s got nothing to do with your making a compact
and breaking it. You&#8217;ve got no right to come here
beefing around about the loss of a few sheep with a
breach of contract on your side of the fence. You&#8217;ve
put it up to me now like you should have done in the
beginning. All right; I&#8217;ll prove myself, like David.
But remember there was another fellow by the name of
Jacob that went in on a livestock deal with a slippery
man, and stick to your agreement this time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to feel that I&#8217;m takin&#8217; advantage
of you, John; I don&#8217;t want you to feel that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just feel it; I know it. I&#8217;ll pay you for the
seven sheep the grizzly killed, and take it out of his
hide when I catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>This offer mollified Tim, melting him down to smiles.
He shook hands with Mackenzie, all the heartiness on
his side, refusing the offer with voluble protestations
that he neither expected nor required it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the makin&#8217; of a sheepman in you, John;
I always thought you had. But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;You want to be shown. All right; I&#8217;m game, even
at forty dollars and found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim beamed at this declaration, but the fires of his
satisfaction he was crafty enough to hide from even
Mackenzie&#8217;s penetrating eyes. Perhaps the glow was
due to a thought that this schoolmaster, who owed his
notoriety in the sheeplands to a lucky blow, would fail,
leaving him far ahead on the deal. He tightened his
girths and set his foot in the stirrup, ready to mount
and ride home; paused so, hand on the saddle-horn,
with a queer, half-puzzled, half-suspicious look in his
sheep-wise eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there something else that feller Jacob was
workin&#8217; for besides the interest in the stock?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me like there was,&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
carelessly. &#8220;The main thing I remember in the transaction
was the stone he set up between the old man and
himself on the range. &#8216;The Lord watch between thee
and me,&#8217; you know, it had on it. That&#8217;s a mighty good
motto yet for a sheepherder to front around where his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
boss can read it. A man&#8217;s got to have somebody to
keep an eye on a sheepman when his back&#8217;s turned, even
today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim laughed, swung into the saddle, where he sat
roving his eyes over the range, and back to the little
band of sheep that seemed only a handful of dust in the
unbounded pastures where they fed. The hillsides were
green in that favored section, greener than anywhere
Mackenzie had been in the sheeplands, the grass already
long for the lack of mouths to feed. Tim&#8217;s face glowed
at the sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the best grazin&#8217; this range has ever produced
in my day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;too much of it here for
that little band you&#8217;re runnin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll send Dad over with
three thousand more this week. You can camp together&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;ll
save me a wagon, and he&#8217;ll be company. How&#8217;s
Joan gettin on with the learnin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s eating it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid it&#8217;d be that way,&#8221; said Tim, gloomily;
&#8220;you can&#8217;t discourage that girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too sincere and capable to be discouraged. I
laid down my hand long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a pity to ruin a good sheepwoman with
learnin&#8217;,&#8221; Tim said, shaking his head with the sadness
of it.</p>
<p>Tim rode away, leaving Mackenzie to his reflections
as he watched his boss&#8217; broad back grow smaller from
hill to hill. The sheepherder smiled as he recalled Tim&#8217;s
puzzled inquiry on the other consideration of Jacob&#8217;s
contract with the slippery Laban.</p>
<p><i>What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou
beguiled me?</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Tim would do it, too,&#8221; Mackenzie said, nodding his
grave head; &#8220;he&#8217;d work off the wrong girl on a man as
sure as he had two.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was queer, the way Tim had thought, at the last
minute, of the &#8220;something else&#8221; Jacob had worked for;
queer, the way he had turned, his foot up in the stirrup,
that puzzled, suspicious expression in his mild, shrewd
face. Even if he should remember on the way home,
or get out his Bible on his arrival and look the story
up, there would be nothing of a parallel between the
case of Jacob and that of John Mackenzie to worry his
sheepman&#8217;s head. For though Jacob served his seven
years for Rachel, which &#8220;seemed to him but a few days,
for the love he had to her,&#8221; he, John Mackenzie, was not
serving Tim Sullivan for Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to that!&#8221; said he, but smiling, a dream in
his eyes, over the thought of what might have been a
parallel case with Jacob&#8217;s, here in the sheeplands of the
western world.</p>
<p>Tim was scarcely out of sight when a man came riding
over the hills from the opposite direction. Mackenzie
sighted him afar off, watching him as each hill lifted
him to a plainer view. He was a stranger, and a man
unsparing of his horse, pushing it uphill and down with
unaltered speed. He rode as if the object of his journey
lay a long distance ahead, and his time for reaching it
was short.</p>
<p>Mackenzie wondered if the fellow had stolen the horse,
having it more than half in mind to challenge his passage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
until he could give an account of his haste, when
he saw that the rider had no intention of going by
without speech. As he mounted the crest of the hill
above the flock, he swung straight for the spot where
Mackenzie stood.</p>
<p>The stranger drew up with a short grunt of greeting,
turning his gaze over the range as if in search of strayed
stock. He was a short, spare man, a frowning cast in
his eyes, a face darkly handsome, but unsympathetic as
a cougar&#8217;s. He looked down at Mackenzie presently,
as if he had put aside the recognition of his presence
as a secondary matter, a cold insolence in his challenging,
sneering eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing over here east of Horsethief?&#8221;
he inquired, bending his black brows in a frown, his
small mustache twitching in catlike threat of a snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grazing that little band of sheep you see down
yonder,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, evenly, running his eyes
over the fellow&#8217;s gear.</p>
<p>This was rather remarkable for a land out of which
strife and contention, murder and sudden death were
believed to have passed long ago. The man wore two
revolvers, slung about his slender frame on a broad
belt looped around for cartridges. These loops were
empty, but the weight of the weapons themselves sagged
the belt far down on the wearer&#8217;s hips. His leather
cuffs were garnitured with silver stars in the Mexican
style; he wore a red stone in his black necktie, which
was tied with care, the flowing ends of it tucked into
the bosom of his dark-gray flannel shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to be funny, cut it out; I&#8217;m not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
funny man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I asked you what you&#8217;re doing
over here east of Horsethief Ca&ntilde;on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s any of your business where I
run my sheep,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, resentful of the
man&#8217;s insolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim Sullivan knows this is our winter grazing land,
and this grass is in reserve. If he didn&#8217;t tell you it
was because he wanted to run you into trouble, I guess.
You&#8217;ll have to get them sheep out of here, and do it
right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger left it to Mackenzie&#8217;s imagination to
fix his identity, not bending to reveal his name. Hector
Hall, Mackenzie knew him to be, on account of his
pistols, on account of the cold meanness of his eyes which
Dad Frazer had described as holding such a throat-cutting
look. But armed as he was, severe and flash-tempered
as he seemed, Mackenzie was not in any sort
of a flurry to give ground before him. He looked up
at him coolly, felt in his pocket for his pipe, filled it
with deliberation, and smoked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got a lease on this land?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I carry my papers right here,&#8221; Hall replied, touching
his belt.</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked about the range as if considering
which way to go. Then, turning again to Hall:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any bounds but the horizon when I&#8217;m
grazing on government land that&#8217;s as much mine as the
next man&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t like to refuse a neighbor a request,
but my sheep are going to stay right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hall leaned over a little, putting out his hand in a
warning gesture, drawing his dark brows in a scowl.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Your head&#8217;s swelled, young feller,&#8221; he said, &#8220;on
account of that lucky thump you landed on Swan Carlson.
You&#8217;ve got about as much chance with that man
as you have with a grizzly bear, and you&#8217;ve got less
chance with me. You&#8217;ve got till this time tomorrow to
be six miles west of here with that band of sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hall rode off with that word, leaving a pretty good
impression that he meant it, and that it was final.
Mackenzie hadn&#8217;t a doubt that he would come back to
see how well the mandate had been obeyed next day.</p>
<p>If there was anything to Hall&#8217;s claim on that territory,
by agreement or right of priority which sheepmen
were supposed to respect between themselves, Tim Sullivan
knew it, Mackenzie reflected. For a month past
Tim had been sending him eastward every time the
wagon was moved, a scheme to widen the distance between
him and Joan and make it an obstacle in her road,
he believed at the time. Now it began to show another
purpose. Perhaps this was the winter pasture claimed
by the Hall brothers, and Tim had sent him in where he
was afraid to come himself.</p>
<p>It seemed a foolish thing to squabble over a piece of
grazing land where all the world lay out of doors, but
Hector Hall&#8217;s way of coming up to it was unpleasant.
It was decidedly offensive, bullying, oppressive. If he
should give way before it he&#8217;d just as well leave the
range, Mackenzie knew; his force would be spent there,
his day closed before it had fairly begun. If he designed
seriously to remain there and become a flockmaster, and
that he intended to do, with all the sincerity in him, he&#8217;d
have to meet Hall&#8217;s bluff with a stronger one, and stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
his ground, whether right or wrong. If wrong, a gentleman&#8217;s
adjustment could be made, his honor saved.</p>
<p>So deciding, he settled that matter, and put it out
of his head until its hour. There was something more
pleasant to cogitate&ndash;&ndash;the parallel of Jacob and Laban,
Tim Sullivan and himself. It was strange how the craft
of Laban had come down to Tim Sullivan across that
mighty flight of time. It would serve Tim the right
turn, in truth, if something should come of it between
him and Joan. He smiled in anticipatory pleasure at
Tim&#8217;s discomfiture and surprise.</p>
<p>But that was not in store for him, he sighed. Joan
would shake her wings out in a little while, and fly away,
leaving him there, a dusty sheepman, among the husks
of his dream. Still, a man might dream on a sunny
afternoon. There was no interdiction against it; Hector
Hall, with his big guns, could not ride in and order
a man off that domain. A shepherd had the ancient
privilege of dreams; he might drink himself drunk on
them, insane on them in the end, as so many of them
were said to do in that land of lonesomeness, where there
was scarcely an echo to give a man back his own faint
voice in mockery of his solitude.</p>
<p>Evening, with the sheep homing to the bedding-ground,
brought reflections of a different hue. Since
the raid on his flock Mackenzie had given up his bunk
in the wagon for a bed under a bush on the hillside
nearer the sheep. Night after night he lay with the
rifle at his hand, waiting the return of the grisly monster
who had spent his fury on the innocent simpletons
in his care.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>Whether it was Swan Carlson, with the strength of
his great arms, driven to madness by the blow he had
received, or whether it was another whom the vast
solitudes of that country had unhinged, Mackenzie did
not know. But that it was man, he had no doubt.</p>
<p>Dad Frazer had gone away unconvinced, unshaken
in his belief that it was a grizzly. Tim Sullivan had
come over with the same opinion, no word of doubt in
his mouth. But Mackenzie knew that when he should
meet that wild night-prowler he would face a thing
more savage than a bear, a thing as terrible to grapple
with as the saber-tooth whose bones lay deep under the
hills of that vast pasture-land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>WILD RIDERS OF THE RANGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Joan missed her lessons for three days running, a
lapse so unusual as to cause Mackenzie the liveliest
concern. He feared that the mad creature who spent
his fury tearing sheep limb from limb might have visited
her camp, and that she had fallen into his bloody
hands.</p>
<p>A matter of eight or nine miles lay between their
camps; Mackenzie had no horse to cover it. More than
once he was on the point of leaving the sheep to shift
for themselves and striking out on foot; many times he
walked a mile or more in that direction, to mount the
highest hill he could discover, and stand long, sweeping
the blue distance with troubled eyes. Yet in the end
he could not go. Whatever was wrong, he could not set
right at that late hour, he reasoned; to leave the sheep
would be to throw open the gates of their defense to
dangers always ready to descend upon them. The sheep
were in his care; Joan was not. That was what Tim
Sullivan would say, in his hard way of holding a man
to his bargain and his task.</p>
<p>Joan came late in the afternoon, rising the nearest
hilltop with a suddenness quite startling, waving a cheerful
greeting as if to assure him from a distance that
all was well. She stood looking at him in amazement
when she flipped to the ground like a bird, her face
growing white, her eyes big.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, what in the world! Where did you get those
guns?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow left them here the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow?&#8221; coming nearer, looking sharply at the
belt. &#8220;That&#8217;s Hector Hall&#8217;s belt&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve seen him wearing
it! There his initials are, worked out in silver tacks!
Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hall left it here. What kept you, Joan? I&#8217;ve
been worried about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector Hall <i>left</i> it here? With both of his guns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he left the guns with it. What was the matter,
Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan looked him up and down, her face a study between
admiration and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Left his guns! Well, what did you do with <i>him</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he went home, Joan. Did anything happen
over your way to keep you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley was sick,&#8221; she said, shortly, abstractedly,
drowned in her wonder of the thing he told with his
native reluctance when questioned on his own exploits.
&#8220;Did you have a fight with Hector?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he all right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley&#8217;s all right; he ate too many wild gooseberries.
Did you have a fight with Hector Hall, Mr.
Mackenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>She came near him as she questioned him, her great,
soft eyes pleading in fear, and laid her hand on his
shoulder as if to hold him against any further evasion.
He smiled a little, in his stingy way of doing it, taking
her hand to allay her tumult of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a fight, Joan. Mr. Hall came over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
here to drive me off of this range, and I had to take his
guns away from him to keep him from hurting me.
That&#8217;s all there was to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All there was to it!&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s one
of the meanest men that ever lived! He&#8217;ll never rest till
he kills you. I wish you&#8217;d let him have the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it his?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it belongs to us; we&#8217;ve got a lease on it from
the government, and pay rent for it every year. Swan
Carlson and the Hall boys have bluffed us out of it
for the past three summers and run their sheep over
here in the winter-time. I always wanted to fight for
it, but dad let them have it for the sake of peace. I
guess it was the best way, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as I was right, my last worry is gone, Joan.
You&#8217;re not on the contested territory, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they lay claim as far as Horsethief Ca&ntilde;on, but
they&#8217;d just as well claim all our lease&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ve got just
as much right to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ends the matter, then&ndash;&ndash;as far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what kind of an excuse Hector made when
he went home without his guns!&#8221; she speculated, looking
off over the hills in the direction of the Hall brothers&#8217;
ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s not accountable to anybody, and doesn&#8217;t
have to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; Joan said, still wandering in
her gaze.</p>
<p>Below them the flock was spread, the dogs on its
flanks. Mackenzie pointed to the sun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get to work; you&#8217;ll be starting back
in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no work in Joan that day, nothing but
troubled speculation on what form Hector Hall&#8217;s revenge
would take, and when the stealthy blow of his
resentment would fall. Try as he would, Mackenzie
could not fasten her mind upon the books. She would
begin with a brave resolution, only to wander away,
the book closed presently upon her thumb, her eyes
searching the hazy hills where trouble lay out of sight.
At last she gave it up, with a little catching sob, tears
in her honest eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll kill you&ndash;&ndash;I know they will!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they will,&#8221; he returned, abstractedly,
&#8220;but even if they do, Rachel, there&#8217;s nobody to grieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rachel? My name isn&#8217;t Rachel,&#8221; said Joan, a little
hurt. For it was not in flippancy or banter that he
had called her out of her name; his eyes were not within
a hundred leagues of that place, his heart away with
them, it seemed, when he spoke.</p>
<p>He turned to her, a color of embarrassment in his
brown face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of another story, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of another girl,&#8221; she said, perhaps a trifle resentfully.
At least Mackenzie thought he read a resentful
note in the quick rejoinder, a resentful flash of color in
her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but a mighty old girl, Joan,&#8221; he confessed,
smiling with a feeling of lightness around his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody you used to know?&#8221; face turned away,
voice light in a careless, artificial note.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She was a sheepman&#8217;s daughter,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know her down at Jasper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never knew her at all, Rach&ndash;&ndash;Joan. That
was a long, long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan brightened at this news. She ceased denying
him her face, even smiled a little, seeming to forget
Hector Hall and his pending vengeance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about her?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He told her which Rachel he had in mind, but Joan
only shook her head and looked troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never read the Bible; we haven&#8217;t even got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her the story, beginning with Jacob&#8217;s setting
out, and his coming to the well with the great stone at
its mouth which the maidens could not roll away.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Jacob rolled the stone away and watered Rachel&#8217;s
sheep,&#8221; he said, pausing with that much of it, looking
off down the draw between the hills in a mind-wandering
way. Joan touched his arm, impatient with such disjointed
narrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he kissed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was kind of fresh,&#8221; said Joan. But she
laughed a little, blushing rosily, a bright light in her
eyes. &#8220;Tell me the rest of it, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie went on with the ancient pastoral tale of
love. Joan was indignant when she heard how Laban
gave Jacob the weak-eyed girl for a wife in place of his
beloved Rachel, for whom he had worked the seven
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake must have been a bright one!&#8221; said she. &#8220;How
could the old man put one over on him like that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to read the story,&#8221; said Mackenzie. &#8220;It&#8217;s
sundown; don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d better be going back
to camp, Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Joan was in no haste to leave. She walked with
him as he worked the sheep to their bedding-ground, her
bridle-rein over her arm. She could get back to camp
before dark, she said; Charley would not be worried.</p>
<p>Joan could not have said as much for herself. Her
eyes were pools of trouble, her face was anxious and
strained. She went silently beside Mackenzie while the
dogs worked the sheep along with more than human
patience, almost human intelligence. Frequently she
looked into his face with a plea dumbly eloquent, but did
not again put her fear for him into words. Only when
she stood beside her horse near the sheep-wagon, ready
to mount and leave him to his solitary supper, she spoke
of Hector Hall&#8217;s revolvers, which Mackenzie had unstrapped
and put aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with them, John?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had fallen into the use of that familiar address
only that day, moved by the tenderness of the old tale
he had told her, perhaps; drawn nearer to him by the
discovery of a gentle sentiment in him which she had not
known before. He heard it with a warm uplifting of the
heart, all without reason, he knew, for it was the range
way to be familiar on a shorter acquaintance than theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give them back to him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been carrying them around ever since he left them in
the hope he&#8217;d get ashamed of himself and come for
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan started at the sound of galloping hoofs, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
rose suddenly out of complete silence as the riders
mounted the crest behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s coming for them now,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There were two riders coming down the slope toward
them at a pace altogether reckless. Mackenzie saw at
a glance that neither of them was Hector Hall, but one
a woman, her loose garments flapping as she rode.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Swan Carlson and his wife!&#8221; he said, unable to
cover his amazement at the sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose they&#8217;re doing over here?&#8221;
Joan drew a little nearer as she spoke, her horse shifting
to keep by her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;No telling. Look how that woman rides!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was enough in her wild bearing to excite admiration
and wonder, even in one who had not seen her
under conditions which promised little of such development.
She came on at Swan&#8217;s side, leaning forward a
little, as light and sure in the saddle as any cowboy on
the range. They bore down toward the sheep-wagon
as if they had no intention of halting, jerking their
horses up in Indian fashion a few feet from where Mackenzie
and Joan stood. The animals slid on stiff legs,
hoofs plowing the soft ground, raising a cloud of dust
which dimmed the riders momentarily.</p>
<p>Neither of the abrupt visitors spoke. They sat
silently staring, not a rod between them and the two on
foot, the woman as unfriendly of face as the man. And
Swan Carlson had not improved in this feature since
Mackenzie parted from him in violence a few weeks
before. His red hair was shorter now, his drooping
mustache longer, the points of it reaching two inches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
below his chin. He was gaunt of cheek, hollow of eyes,
like a man who had gone hungry or suffered a sorrow
that ate away his heart.</p>
<p>His wife had improved somewhat in outward appearance.
Her face had filled, the pathetic uncertainty had
gone from her eyes. She was not uncomely as she sat
astride her good bay horse, her divided skirt of corduroy
wide on its flanks, a man&#8217;s gray shirt laced over her
bosom, the collar open, showing the fairness of her neck.
Her abundant hair was braided, and wound closely about
her head like a cap. Freedom had made a strange alteration
in her. It seemed, indeed, as if Swan Carlson had
breathed into her the breath of his own wild soul, making
her over according to the desire of his heart.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stepped out in invitation for Swan to state
the occasion of his boisterous visit, and stood waiting
in silence while the two strange creatures continued to
stare. Swan lifted his hand in a manner of salutation,
no change either of friendship or animosity in his lean,
strong face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a woman, huh? Well, how&#8217;ll you trade?&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan glanced from his wife to Joan as he spoke. If
there was any recollection in him of the hard usage he
had received at Mackenzie&#8217;s hands, it did not seem to
be bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride on,&#8221; said Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson urged her horse with sudden start close
to where Joan stood, leaned far over her saddle and
peered into the girl&#8217;s face. Joan, affronted by the savage
impertinence, met her eyes defiantly, not giving an
inch before the unexpected charge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>In that pose of defiant challenge Swan Carlson&#8217;s
woman peered into the face of the girl whose freshness
and beauty had drawn the wild banter from her man&#8217;s
bold lips. Then, a sudden sweep of passion in her face,
she lifted her rawhide quirt and struck Joan a bitter
blow across the shoulder and neck. Mackenzie sprang
between them, but Mrs. Carlson, her defiance passed in
that one blow, did not follow it up. Swan opened wide
his great mouth and pealed out his roaring laughter, not
a line of mirth softening in his face, not a gleam of it in
his eyes. It was a sound without a note to express
human warmth, or human satisfaction.</p>
<p>Joan flamed up like a match in oil. She dropped her
bridle-reins, springing back a quick step, turning her
eyes about for some weapon by which she might retaliate.
Hector Hall&#8217;s pistols hung on the end-gate of the
sheep-wagon not more than twenty feet away. It seemed
that Joan covered the distance in a bound, snatched one
of the guns and fired. Her own horse stood between her
and the wild range woman, which perhaps accounted for
her miss. Mackenzie was holding her wrist before she
could shoot again.</p>
<p>Swan let out another roar of heartless laughter, and
together with his woman galloped down the hill. Ahead
of them the sheep were assembled, packed close in their
huddling way of seeking comfort and courage in numbers,
just beginning to compose themselves for the night.
Straight into the flock Swan Carlson and his woman
rode, trampling such as could not rise and leap aside,
crushing such lambs as were not nimble enough or wise
enough to run.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill her, I&#8217;ll kill her!&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>She panted, half crying, struggling to free her arm
that she might fire again.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let &#8217;em have it!&#8221; Mackenzie said, seeing the
havoc among the sheep.</p>
<p>Swan and his woman rode like a whirlwind through
the flock, the dogs after them with sharp cries, the
frightened bleating of the lambs, the beating of two
thousand hoofs, adding to the confusion of what had
been a peaceful pastoral scene but a few minutes before.
Joan cut loose at the disturbers of this peace, emptying
the revolver quickly, but without effect.</p>
<p>Half way through the herd Swan leaned down and
caught a lamb by the leg, swung it around his head as
lightly as a man would wave his hat, and rode on with
it in savage triumph. Mackenzie snatched the rifle from
the wagon. His shot came so close to Swan that he
dropped the lamb. The woman fell behind Swan, interposing
herself as a shield, and in this formation they
rode on, sweeping down the narrow thread of green
valley, galloping wildly away into the sanctuary of
the hills.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood, gun half lifted, and watched them
go without another shot, afraid to risk it lest he hit the
woman. He turned to Joan, who stood by, white with
anger, the empty revolver in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, Joan?&#8221; he asked, in foolish weakness,
knowing very well that she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t hurt me&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;ll kill her for it!&#8221;
said Joan.</p>
<p>She was trembling; her face was bloodless in the cold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
anger that shook her. There was a red welt on her neck,
purple-marked on its ridge where the rawhide had almost
cut her tender skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan Carlson has pulled his woman down to his
savage level at last,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s worse than he is; she&#8217;s a range wolf!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she is. But it always happens that way
when a person gets to going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With those two and the Hall boys you&#8217;ll not have a
ghost of a chance to hold this range, John. You&#8217;d better
let me help you begin working the sheep over toward
my camp tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan and that woman just rode through here to get
the lay of your camp. More than likely they&#8217;ll come
over and burn you out tonight&ndash;&ndash;pour coal oil on the
wagon and set it afire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em; I&#8217;ll not be in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll worry you night and day, kill your sheep,
maybe kill you, if you don&#8217;t come away. It isn&#8217;t worth
it; dad was right about it. For the sake of peace, let
them have it, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood in silence, looking the way Swan and
his woman had gone, the gun held as if ready to lift and
fire at the showing of a hat-crown over the next hill.
He seemed to be considering the situation. Joan studied
his face with eager hopefulness, bending forward a bit
to see better in the failing light.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to be shown that a master has come to
the sheep country,&#8221; he said, in low voice, as if to himself.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay and prove it to all of them at once.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>Joan knew there was no use to argue or appeal. She
dropped the matter there, and Mackenzie put the gun
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t anything to put on it,&#8221; he said,
looking at the red welt on her neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I missed her,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much the sting of a blow, I know,&#8221; he
comforted, &#8220;as the hurt of the insult. Never mind it,
Joan; she&#8217;s a vicious, wild woman, jealous because Swam
took notice of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great compliment!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had some balm for it that would cure it in a
second, and take away the memory of the way it was
done,&#8221; said he, very softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill her,&#8221; flared Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear you say that, Joan,&#8221; he chided,
and reached and laid his hand consolingly upon the
burning mark.</p>
<p>Joan caught her breath as if he had touched her skin
with ice. He withdrew his hand quickly, blaming himself
for the rudeness of his rough hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t hurt me, John,&#8221; she said, her eyes downcast,
the color of warm blood playing over her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have,&#8221; he blamed himself, in such seriousness
as if it were the gravest matter he had risked, and
not the mere touching of a blood-red welt upon a simple
maiden&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be over early in the morning to see if you&#8217;re all
right,&#8221; she told him as she turned again to her horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can come, even to show yourself on the hill,&#8221;
said he.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Show myself? Why, a person would think you were
worrying about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, Joan. I wish you would give up herding
sheep, let the share and the prospect and all of it go,
and have your father put a herder in to run that band
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll not hurt me; as mean as they are they&#8217;ll not
fight a woman. Anyway, I&#8217;m not over the deadline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something prowling this range that doesn&#8217;t
respect lines, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the grizzly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the grizzly that rides a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad Frazer thinks you were mistaken on that,
John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. Dad Frazer thinks I&#8217;m a better schoolteacher
than I&#8217;ll ever be a sheepman, I guess. But I&#8217;ve
met bears enough that I don&#8217;t have to imagine them.
Keep your gun close by you tonight, and every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; she promised, moved by the earnestness of
his appeal.</p>
<p>Dusk was thickening into darkness over the sheeplands;
the dogs were driving the straggling sheep back
to the bedding-ground, where many of them already lay
in contentment, quickly over the flurry of Swan Carlson&#8217;s
passing. Joan stood at her stirrup, her face lifted
to the heavens, and it was white as an evening primrose
under the shadow of her hat. She lingered as if there
remained something to say or be said, something to give
or to take, before leaving her friend and teacher alone
to face the dangers of the night. Perhaps she thought
of Rachel, and the kiss her kinsman gave her when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth, and lifted up his
voice and wept.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood a little apart, thinking his own swift-running
thoughts, quickening under the leap of his own
eager blood. But no matter for Jacob&#8217;s precedent,
Mackenzie had no excuse of even distant relationship to
offer for such familiarity. The desire was urging, but
the justification was not at hand. So Joan rode away
unkissed, and perhaps wondering why.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>HECTOR HALL SETS A BEACON</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie sat a long time on his hill that
night, his ear turned to the wind, smoking his
pipe and thinking the situation over while listening for
the first sound of commotion among the sheep. He had
pledged himself to Tim and Joan that he would not quit
the sheep country without proving that he had in him
the mettle of a flockmaster. Hector Hall had been
given to understand the same thing. In fact, Mackenzie
thought, it looked as if he had been running with his
eyes shut, making boastful pledges.</p>
<p>He might have to hedge on some of them, or put them
through at a cost far beyond the profit. It came that
way to a boaster of his intentions sometimes, especially
so when a man spoke too quickly and assumed too much.
Here he was standing face to a fight that did not appear
to promise much more glory in the winning than in the
running away.</p>
<p>There had been peace in that part of the sheep
country a long time; Mackenzie had come to Jasper,
even, long after the feuds between the flockmasters and
cattlemen had worn themselves out save for an outbreak
of little consequence in the far places now and then.
But the peace of this place had been a coward&#8217;s peace,
paid for in money and humiliation. A thing like that
was not to be expected of Tim Sullivan, although from a
business reasoning he doubtless was right about it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>It was Mackenzie&#8217;s work now to clean up the camp of
the Hall brothers, along with Swan Carlson, and put an
end to their bullying and edging over on Tim Sullivan&#8217;s
range, or take up his pack and trudge out of the sheep
country as he had come. By staying there and fighting
for Tim Sullivan&#8217;s interests he might arrive in time at a
dusty consequence, his fame, measured in thousands of
sheep, reaching even to Jasper and Cheyenne, and perhaps
to the stock-yards commission offices in Omaha and
Chicago.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Mackenzie, worth twenty thousand, or fifty
thousand sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>That would be the way they would know him; that
would be the measure of his fame. By what sacrifice,
through what adventure, how much striving and hard
living he might come to the fame of twenty thousand
sheep, no man would know or care. There in the dusty
silences of that gray-green land he would bury the man
and the soul that reached upward in him with pleasant
ambitions, to become a creature over sheep. Just a step
higher than the sheep themselves, wind-buffeted, cold-cursed,
seared and blistered and hardened like a callous
through which the urging call of a man&#8217;s duty among
men could pierce no more.</p>
<p>But it had its compensations, on the other hand.
There must be a vast satisfaction in looking back over
the small triumphs won against tremendous forces, the
successful contest with wild winter storm, ravaging
disease, night-prowling beasts. Nature was the big
force arrayed against a flockmaster, and it was unkind
and menacing seven months out of the year. That must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
be the secret of a flockmaster&#8217;s satisfaction with himself
and his lot, Mackenzie thought; he could count himself
a fit companion for the old gods, if he knew anything
about them, after his victory over every wild force
that could be bent against him among those unsheltered
hills.</p>
<p>The Hall brothers were a small pest to be stamped
out and forgotten in the prosperity of multiplying
flocks. As for Swan Carlson, poor savage, there might
be some way of reaching him without further violence
between them. Wild and unfeeling as he seemed, there
must be a sense of justice in him, reading him by his
stern, immobile face.</p>
<p>As he sat and weighed the argument for and against
the sheep business, the calling of flockmaster began to
take on the color of romantic attraction which had not
been apparent to him before. In his way, every flockmaster
was a hero, inflexible against the unreckoned
forces which rose continually to discourage him. This
was true, as he long had realized, of a man who plants in
the soil, risking the large part of his capital of labor
year by year. But the sheepman&#8217;s risks were greater,
his courage immensely superior, to that of the tiller of
the soil. One storm might take his flock down to the
last head, leaving him nothing to start on again but his
courage and his hope.</p>
<p>It appeared to Mackenzie to be the calling of a
proper man. A flockmaster need not be a slave to the
range, as most of them were. He might sit in his office,
as a few of them did, and do the thing like a gentleman.
There were possibilities of dignity in it heretofore overlooked;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Joan would think better of it if she could see it
done that way. Surely, it was a business that called for
a fight to build and a fight to hold, but it was the calling
of a proper man.</p>
<p>Mackenzie was immensely cheered by his reasoning
the sheep business into the romantic and heroic class.
Here were allurements of which he had not dreamed, to
be equaled only by the calling of the sea, and not by
any other pursuit on land at all. A man who appreciated
the subtle shadings of life could draw a great deal
of enjoyment and self-pride out of the business of flockmaster.
It was one of the most ancient pursuits of man.
Abraham was a flockmaster; maybe Adam.</p>
<p>But for all of the new comfort he had found in the
calling he had adopted, Mackenzie was plagued by a
restless, broken sleep when he composed himself among
the hillside shrubs above the sheep. A vague sense
of something impending held him from rest. It was
present over his senses like a veil of drifting smoke
through his shallow sleep. Twice he moved his bed, with
the caution of some haunted beast; many times he
started in his sleep, clutching like a falling man, to sit
up alert and instantly awake.</p>
<p>There was something in the very tension of the night-silence
that warned him to be on the watch. It was not
until long after midnight that he relaxed his straining,
uneasy vigil, and stretched himself to unvexed sleep.
He could steal an hour or two from the sheep in the
early morning, he told himself, as he felt the sweet restfulness
of slumber sweeping over him; the helpless creatures
would remain on the bedding-ground long after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sunrise if he did not wake, waiting for him to come and
set them about the great business of their lives. They
hadn&#8217;t sense enough to range out and feed themselves
without the direction of man&#8217;s guiding hand.</p>
<p>Mackenzie had dipped but a little way into his refreshing
rest when the alarmed barking of his dogs
woke him with such sudden wrench that it ached. He
sat up, senses drenched in sleep for a struggling moment,
groping for his rifle. The dogs went charging up the
slope toward the wagon, the canvas top of which he
could see indistinctly on the hillside through the dark.</p>
<p>As Mackenzie came to his feet, fully awake and on
edge, the dogs mouthed their cries as if they closed in
on the disturber of the night at close quarters. Mackenzie
heard blows, a yelp from a disabled dog, and retreat
toward him of those that remained unhurt. He
fired a shot, aiming high, running toward the wagon.</p>
<p>Again the dogs charged, two of them, only, out of the
three, and again there was the sound of thick, rapid
blows. One dog came back to its master, pressing
against his legs for courage. Mackenzie shouted, hoping
to draw the intruder into revealing himself, not
wanting the blood of even a rascal such as the night-prowler
on his hands through a chance shot into the
dark. There was no answer, no sound from the deep
blackness that pressed like troubled waters close to the
ground.</p>
<p>The dog clung near to Mackenzie&#8217;s side, his growling
deep in his throat. Mackenzie could feel the beast
tremble as it pressed against him, and bent to caress it
and give it confidence. At his reassuring touch the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
beast bounded forward to the charge again, only to
come yelping back, and continue on down the hill toward
the flock.</p>
<p>Mackenzie fired again, dodging quickly behind a
clump of bushes after the flash of his gun. As he
crouched there, peering and straining ahead into the
dark, strong hands laid hold of him, and tore his rifle
away from him and flung him to the ground. One came
running from the wagon, low words passed between the
man who held Mackenzie pinned to the ground, knees
astride him, his hands doubled back against his chin in
a grip that was like fetters. This one who arrived in
haste groped around until he found Mackenzie&#8217;s rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood, his captor twisting his arms behind
him with such silent ease that it was ominous of what
might be expected should the sheepherder set up a
struggle to break free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud, I&#8217;ve come over after my guns,&#8221; said Hector
Hall, speaking close to Mackenzie&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re up at the wagon,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, with
rather an injured air. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t need to make all
this trouble about it; I was keeping them for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on up and get &#8217;em,&#8221; Hall commanded, prodding
Mackenzie in the ribs with the barrel of his own gun.</p>
<p>The one who held Mackenzie said nothing, but walked
behind him, rather shoved him ahead, hands twisted in
painful rigidity behind his back, pushing him along as if
his weight amounted to no more than a child&#8217;s. At the
wagon Hall fell in beside Mackenzie, the barrel of a gun
again at his side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; he said. And to Mackenzie: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
try to throw any tricks on me, bud, but waltz around
and get me them guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hanging on the end of the coupling-pole;
get them yourself,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, resentful of
this treatment, humiliated to such depths by this disgrace
that had overtaken him that he cared little for
the moment whether he should live or die.</p>
<p>Hall spoke a low, mumbled, unintelligible word to
the one who stood behind Mackenzie, and another gun
pressed coldly against the back of the apprentice sheepman&#8217;s
neck. Hall went to the end of the wagon, found
his pistols, struck a match to inspect them. In the
light of the expiring match at his feet Mackenzie could
see the ex-cattleman buckling on the guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud, you&#8217;ve been actin&#8217; kind of rash around here,&#8221;
Hall said, in insolent satisfaction with the turn of
events. &#8220;You had your lucky day with me, like you had
with Swan Carlson, but I gave you a sneak&#8217;s chance to
leave the country while the goin&#8217; was good. If you ever
leave it now the wind&#8217;ll blow you out. Back him up to
that wagon wheel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was at the end of his tractable yielding to
commands, seeing dimly what lay before him. He lashed
out in fury at the man who pressed the weapon to his
neck, twisting round in a sweep of passion that made
the night seem to burst in a rain of fire, careless of what
immediate danger he ran. The fellow fired as Mackenzie
swung round, the flash of the flame hot on his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot him, you fool!&#8221; Hector Hall interposed,
his voice a growl between his teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s quick blows seemed to fall impotently on
the body of the man who now grappled with him, face
to face, Hector Hall throwing himself into the tangle
from the rear. Mackenzie, seeing his assault shaping
for a speedy end in his own defeat, now attempted to
break away and seek shelter in the dark among the
bushes. He wrenched free for a moment, ducked, ran,
only to come down in a few yards with Hector Hall on
his back like a catamount.</p>
<p>Fighting every inch of the way, Mackenzie was
dragged back to the wagon, where his captors backed
him against one of the hind wheels and bound him, his
arms outstretched across the spokes in the manner of a
man crucified.</p>
<p>They had used Mackenzie illy in that fight to get him
back to the wagon; his face was bleeding, a blow in the
mouth had puffed his lips. His hat was gone, his shirt
torn open on his bosom, but a wild rage throbbed in
him which lifted him above the thought of consequences
as he strained at the ropes which held his arms.</p>
<p>They left his feet free, as if to mock him with half
liberty in the ordeal they had set for him to face. One
mounted the front wagon wheel near Mackenzie, and
the light of slow-coming dawn on the sky beyond him
showed his hand uplifted as if he sprinkled something
over the wagon sheet. The smell of kerosene spread
through the still air; a match crackled on the wagon
tire. A flash, a sudden springing of flame, a roar, and
the canvas was enveloped in fire.</p>
<p>Mackenzie leaned against his bonds, straining away
from the sudden heat, the fast-running fire eating the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
canvas from the bows, the bunk within, and all the furnishings
and supplies, on fire. There seemed to be no
wind, a merciful circumstance, for a whip of the high-striving
flames would have wrapped him, stifling out his
life in a moment.</p>
<p>Hall and the other man, who had striven with Mackenzie
in such powerful silence, had drawn away from
the fire beyond his sight to enjoy the thing they had
done. Mackenzie, turning his fearful gaze over his
shoulder, calculated his life in seconds. The fire was at
his back, his hair was crinkling in the heat of it, a little
moving breath of wind to fill the sudden vacuum drew a
tongue of blaze with sharp threat against his cheek.</p>
<p>In a moment the oil-drenched canvas would be gone,
the flaming contents of the wagon, the woodwork of box
and running gears left to burn more slowly, and his flesh
and bones must mingle ashes with the ashes, to be blown
on the wind, as Hector Hall had so grimly prophesied.
What a pitiful, poor, useless ending of all his calculations
and plans!</p>
<p>A shot at the top of the hill behind the wagon, a rush
of galloping hoofs; another shot, and another. Below
him Hall and his comrade rode away, floundering in
haste through the sleeping flock, the one poor dog left
out of Mackenzie&#8217;s three tearing after them, venting his
impotent defiance in sharp yelps of the chase.</p>
<p>Joan. Mackenzie knew it was Joan before she came
riding into the firelight, throwing herself from the
horse before it stopped. Through the pain of his
despair&ndash;&ndash;above the rebellious resentment of the thing
that fate had played upon him this bitter gray morning;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
above the anguish of his hopeless moment, the poignant
striving of his tortured soul to meet the end with
resolution and calm defiance worthy a man&ndash;&ndash;he had expected
Joan.</p>
<p>Why, based on what reason, he could not have told,
then nor in the years that came afterward. But always
the thought of Joan coming to him like the wings of
light out of the east.</p>
<p>And so Joan had come, as he strained on his bound
arms to draw his face a few inches farther from the fire,
as he stifled in the smoke and heavy gases of the burning
oil; Joan had come, and her hand was cool on his forehead,
her voice was tender in his ear, and she was leading
him into the blessed free air, the east widening in a bar
of light like a waking eye.</p>
<p>Joan was panting, the knife that had cut his bonds
still open in her hand. They stood face to face, a little
space between them, her great eyes pouring their terrified
sympathy into his soul. Neither spoke, a daze over
them, a numbness on their tongues, the dull shock of
death&#8217;s close passing bewildering and deep.</p>
<p>Mackenzie breathed deeply, his brain clearing out of
its racing whirl, and became conscious of Joan&#8217;s hand
grasping his. Behind them the ammunition in the burning
wagon began to explode, and Joan, shuddering as
with cold, covered her white face with her hands and
sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Mackenzie touched her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan! O Joan, Joan!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Joan, shivering, her shoulders lifted as if to fend
against a winter blast, only cried the harder into her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
hands. He stood with hand touching her shoulder
lightly, the quiver of her body shaking him to the heart.
But no matter how inviting the opening, a man could
not speak what rose in his heart to say, standing as he
stood, a debtor in such measure. To say what he would
have said to Joan, he must stand clear and towering in
manliness, no taint of humiliation on his soul.</p>
<p>Mackenzie groaned in spirit, and his words were a
groan, as he said again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan! O Joan, Joan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew they&#8217;d come tonight&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for your wakefulness!&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>She was passing out of the reefs of terror, calming as
a wind falls at sunset. Mackenzie pressed her arm,
drawing her away a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ammunition&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;d better&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joan, and went with him a little farther
down the slope.</p>
<p>Mackenzie put his hand to his face where the flames
had licked it, and to the back of his head where his
scorched hair broke crisply under his palm. Joan looked
at him, the aging stamp of waking and worry in her
face, exclaiming pityingly when she saw his hurts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It served me right; I stumbled into their hands like
a blind kitten!&#8221; he said, not sparing himself of scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cattleman&#8217;s trick; many an older hand than
you has gone that way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I&#8217;d have waked and watched like you, Joan,
they wouldn&#8217;t have got me. I started to watch, but I
didn&#8217;t keep it up like you. When I should have been
awake, I was sleeping like a sluggard.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The cowards!&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I let one of them sneak up behind me, after they&#8217;d
clubbed two of the dogs to death, and grab me and get
my gun! Great God! I deserve to be burned!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she chided, fearfully. &#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them was Hector Hall&ndash;&ndash;he came after his
guns. If I&#8217;d been a man, the shadow of a man, I&#8217;d made
him swallow them the day I took&ndash;&ndash;the time he left them
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt was with him,&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t do
anything; no man could do anything, against Matt
Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They handled me like a baby,&#8221; said he, bitterly,
&#8220;and I, and I, wanting to be a sheepman! No wonder
they think I&#8217;m a soft and simple fool up here, that goes
on the reputation of a lucky blow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man on a horse,&#8221; said Joan. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming
this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rider broke down the hillside as she spoke, riding
near the wreckage of the burning wagon, where he
halted a moment, the strong light of the fire on his face:
Swan Carlson, hatless, his hair streaming, his great
mustache pendant beside his stony mouth. He came
on toward them at once. Joan laid her hand on her
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a fire here,&#8221; said Swan, stopping near them,
leaning curiously toward them as if he peered at them
through smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mackenzie returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen it from over there,&#8221; said Swan. &#8220;I come over
to see if you needed any help.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, not now. It&#8217;s gone; nothing can be
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I smelt coal oil,&#8221; said Swan, throwing back his head,
sniffing the air like a buck. &#8220;Who done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of your neighbors,&#8221; said Mackenzie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed they would,&#8221; Swan nodded. &#8220;Them fellers
don&#8217;t fight like me and you, they don&#8217;t stand up like a
man. When I seen you take that feller by the leg that
day and upset him off of his horse and grab his guns off
of him, I knowed he&#8217;d burn you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan, forgetting her fear and dislike of Swan Carlson
in her interest of what he revealed, drew a little
nearer to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you around here that day, Swan?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him upset that feller, little bird,&#8221; Swan
said, leaning again from his saddle, his long neck
stretched to peer into her face. &#8220;He&#8217;s a good man, but
he ain&#8217;t as good a man as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan was barefooted, just as he had leaped from his
bunk in the sheep-wagon to ride to the fire. There was a
wild, high pride in his cold, handsome face as he sat up
in the saddle as if to show Joan his mighty bulk, and he
stretched out his long arms like an eagle on its crag
flexing its pinions in the morning sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he&ndash;&ndash;did Hector Hall sling a gun on Mr. Mackenzie
that time?&#8221; she asked, pressing forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Joan&ndash;&ndash;let that go,&#8221; said Mackenzie,
putting his arm before her to stay her, speaking hastily,
as if to warn her back from a danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have time to sling a gun on him,&#8221; said
Swan, great satisfaction in his voice as he recalled the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
scene. &#8220;Your man he&#8217;s like a cat when he jumps for a
feller, but he ain&#8217;t got the muscle in his back like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody in this country like you, Swan,&#8221;
said Joan, pleased with him, friendly toward him, for
his praise of the one he boldly called her man.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can roll &#8217;em all,&#8221; Swan said, as gravely as if
he would be hung on the testimony. &#8220;You ought to
have me for your man; then you&#8217;d have somebody no
feller on this range would burn out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a wife, Swan,&#8221; Joan said, with gentle
reproof, but putting the proposal from her as if she
considered it a jest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of that one,&#8221; Swan confessed, frankly.
Then to Mackenzie: &#8220;I&#8217;ll fight you for her.&#8221; He
swung half way out of the saddle, as if to come to the
ground and start the contest on the moment, hung
there, looking Mackenzie in the face, the light of morning
revealing the marks of his recent battle. &#8220;Not now,
you&#8217;ve had a fight already,&#8221; said Swan, settling back
into the saddle. &#8220;But when you brace up, then I&#8217;ll fight
you for her. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, speaking easily, as
if humoring the whim of some irresponsible person.</p>
<p>With a sudden start of his horse Swan rode close to
Joan, Mackenzie throwing himself between them, catching
the bridle, hurling the animal back. Swan did not
take notice of the interference, only leaned far over,
stretching his long neck, his great mustaches like the
tusks of an old walrus, and strained a long look into
Joan&#8217;s face. Then he whirled his horse and galloped
away, not turning a glance behind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Joan watched him go, saying nothing for a little
while. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s joking,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he is,&#8221; Mackenzie agreed, although he had
many doubts.</p>
<p>They turned to look at the wagon again, the popping
of ammunition having ceased. The woodwork was all on
fire; soon it would be reduced to bolts and tires. Joan&#8217;s
spirits seemed to have risen with the broadening of day,
in spite of Swan Carlson&#8217;s visit and his bold jest, if jest
he meant it to be. She laughed as she looked at the
sheep, huddled below them in attitude of helpless fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little fools!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Well, I must go back
to Charley. Don&#8217;t tell dad I was over here, please,
John. He wouldn&#8217;t like it if he knew I&#8217;d butted in this
way&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s scared to death of the Halls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m to keep him from knowing it,&#8221;
Mackenzie said, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see why he shouldn&#8217;t know.
He&#8217;d have been out a cheap herder if it hadn&#8217;t been for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t tell him, you mustn&#8217;t let anybody
know I was here, John,&#8221; she said, lifting her eyes to his
in an appeal far stronger than words. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do
for dad&ndash;&ndash;for anybody&ndash;&ndash;to know I was here. You
don&#8217;t need to say anything about them tying&ndash;&ndash;doing&ndash;&ndash;<i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan shuddered again in that chilling, horrified way,
turning from him to hide what he believed he had read
in her words and face before.</p>
<p>It was not because she feared to have her father know
she had come riding to his rescue in the last hours of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
her troubled night; not because she feared his censure or
his anger, or wanted to conceal her deed for reasons of
modesty from anyone. Only to spare him the humiliation
of having his failure known, Mackenzie understood.
That was her purpose, and her sole purpose, in seeking
his pledge to secrecy.</p>
<p>It would hurt him to have it go abroad that he had
allowed them to sneak into his camp, seize him, disarm
him, bind him, and set the fire that was to make ashes of
him for the winds to blow away. It would do for him
with Tim Sullivan entirely if that should become known,
with the additional humiliation of being saved from this
shameful death by a woman. No matter how immeasurable
his own gratitude, no matter how wide his own
pride in her for what she had done, the sheep country
never would be able to see it with his eyes. It would be
another smirch for him, and such a deep one as to obscure
him and his chances there forever.</p>
<p>Joan knew it. In her generosity, her interest for his
future, she wanted her part in it to remain unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must promise me, John,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never
come to take another lesson unless you promise me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you, God bless you, Joan!&#8221; said he.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>ONE COMES TO SERVE</h3>
</div>
<p>An hour after midday there came riding over the
hills Tim Sullivan and a stranger. They stopped
at the ruins of the sheep-wagon, where Tim dismounted
and nosed around, then came on down the draw, where
Mackenzie was ranging the sheep.</p>
<p>Tim was greatly exercised over the loss of the wagon.
He pitched into Mackenzie about it as soon as he came
within speaking distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you do it&ndash;&ndash;kick over the lantern?&#8221; he inquired,
his face cloudy with ill-held wrath.</p>
<p>Mackenzie explained, gruffly and in few words, how
the wagon was fired, sparing his own perilous adventure
and the part that Joan had borne in it. This slowed
Tim down, and set him craning his neck over the country
to see if any further threat of violence impended on the
horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them Hall boys ought to be men enough not to do
me a trick like that after the way I&#8217;ve give in to them on
this side of the range,&#8221; he said. Then to Mackenzie,
sharply: &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; happened if you hadn&#8217;t took
Hector&#8217;s guns away from him that time. A sheepman&#8217;s
got no right to be fightin&#8217; around on the range. If he
wants to brawl and scrap, let him do it when he goes to
town, the way the cowboys used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right; I&#8217;m beginning to think you
are,&#8221; Mackenzie returned.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Right? Of course I&#8217;m right. A sheepman&#8217;s got to
set his head to business, and watchin&#8217; the corners to prevent
losses like this that eats up the profit, and not go
around with his sleeves rolled up and his jaw slewed,
lookin&#8217; for a fight. And if he starts one he&#8217;s got to have
the backbone and the gizzard to hold up his end of it,
and not let &#8217;em put a thing like this over on him. Why
wasn&#8217;t you in the wagon last night watchin&#8217; it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve been expecting them to burn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you&#8217;ve been expectin&#8217; &#8217;em to burn you out, and
you hid in the brush with your tail between your legs
like a kicked pup and let &#8217;em set my new wagon afire.
How did you git your face bunged up that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell down,&#8221; Mackenzie said, with a sarcasm meant
only for himself, feeling that he had described his
handling of the past situation in a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Runnin&#8217; off, I reckon. Well, I tell you, John, it
won&#8217;t do, that kind of business won&#8217;t do. Them Hall
boys are mighty rough fellers, too rough for a boy like
you that&#8217;s been runnin&#8217; with school children all his life.
You got some kind of a lucky hitch on Hector when you
stripped that belt and guns off of him&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know
how you done it; it&#8217;s a miracle he didn&#8217;t nail you down
with lead&ndash;&ndash;but that kind of luck won&#8217;t play into a man&#8217;s
hands one time in a thousand. You never ought &#8217;a&#8217;
started anything with them fellers unless you had the
weight in your hind-quarters to keep it goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Mackenzie, swallowing the rebuke
like a bitter pill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right? You make me tired standin&#8217; there and takin&#8217;
it like a sick cat! If you was half the man I took you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
to be when you struck this range you&#8217;d resent a callin&#8217;
down like I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you. But you don&#8217;t resent it, you
take it, like you sneaked and let them fellers burn that
wagon and them supplies of mine. If you was expectin&#8217;
&#8217;em to turn that kind of a trick you ought &#8217;a&#8217; been right
there in that wagon, watchin&#8217; it&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s where you had
a right to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there&#8217;s where I&#8217;d been if I had your nerve,
Sullivan,&#8221; Mackenzie said, his slow anger taking place
of the humiliation that had bent him down all morning
like a shameful load. &#8220;Everybody on this range knows
you&#8217;re a fighting man&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve fought the wind gettin&#8217;
away from this side of the range every time you saw
smoke, you&#8217;ve got a reputation for standing out for
your rights like a man with a gizzard in him as big as a
sack of bran! Sure, I know all about the way you&#8217;ve
backed out of here and let Carlson and the Halls bluff
you out of the land you pay rent on, right along. If
I had your nerve&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Tim&#8217;s face flamed as if he had risen from turning
batter-cakes over a fire. He made a smoothing, adjusting,
pacificating gesture with his hands, looking with
something between deep concern and shame over his
shoulder at the man who accompanied him, and who
sat off a few feet in his saddle, a grin over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, John, I don&#8217;t mean for you to take it that I&#8217;m
throwin&#8217; any slur over your courage for the way things
has turned out&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want you to take it that way
at all, lad,&#8221; said Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fighting man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Mackenzie was getting
hotter as he went on&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;everybody in here knows that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
by now, I guess. You guessed wrong, Sullivan, when
you took me for one and put me over here to hold this
range for you that this crowd&#8217;s been backing you off of
a little farther each spring. You&#8217;re the brave spirit
that&#8217;s needed here&ndash;&ndash;if somebody could tie you and hold
you to face the men that have robbed you of the best
range you&#8217;ve got. I put down my hand; I get out of
the way for you when it comes to the grit to put up a
fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t take it to heart what I&#8217;ve been sayin&#8217;, lad.
A man&#8217;s hot under the collar when he sees a dirty trick
like that turned on him, but it passes off like sweat,
John. Let it go, boy, let it pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent me in here expecting me to fight, and
when I don&#8217;t always come out on top you rib me like
the devil&#8217;s own for it. You expected me to fight to hold
this grass, but you didn&#8217;t expect me to lose anything
at all. Well, I&#8217;ll hold the range for you, Sullivan; you
don&#8217;t need to lose any sleep over that. But if I&#8217;m willing
to risk my skin to do it, by thunder, you ought to
be game enough to stand the loss of a wagon without
a holler that can be heard to Four Corners!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doin&#8217; fine holdin&#8217; my range that I pay solid
money to Uncle Sam for, you&#8217;re doin&#8217; elegant fine, lad.
I was hasty, my tongue got out from under the bit,
boy. Let it pass; don&#8217;t you go holdin&#8217; it against an old
feller like me that&#8217;s got the worry of forty-odd thousand
sheep on his mind day and night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough to say, but it don&#8217;t let you out.
You&#8217;ve got no call to come here and wade into me without
knowing anything about the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, John, sound and right. I was hasty,
I was too hot. You&#8217;ve done fine here, you&#8217;re the first
man that&#8217;s ever stood up to them fellers and held &#8217;em off
my grass. You&#8217;ve done things up like a man, John. I
give it to you&ndash;&ndash;like a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Mackenzie, in dry scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no kick to make over the loss of my
wagon&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s been many a day since I had one burnt up
on me that way. Pass it up, pass up anything I&#8217;ve said
about it, John. That&#8217;s the lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>So John passed it up, and unbent to meet the young
man who rode with Tim, whom the sheepman presented
as Earl Reid, from Omaha, son of Malcolm Reid, an old
range partner and friend. The young man had come
out to learn the sheep business; Tim had brought him
over for Mackenzie to break in. Dad Frazer was coming
along with three thousand sheep, due to arrive in
about a week. When he got there, the apprentice would
split his time between them.</p>
<p>Mackenzie received the apprentice as cordially as he
could, but it was not as ardent a welcome as the young
man may have expected, owing to the gloom of resentment
into which Sullivan&#8217;s outbreak had thrown this
unlucky herder on the frontier of the range.</p>
<p>Reid was rather a sophisticated looking youth of
twenty-two or twenty-three, city broke, city marked.
There was a poolroom pallor about this thin face, a poolroom
stoop to his thin shoulders, that Mackenzie did
not like. But he was frank and ingenuous in his manner,
with a ready smile that redeemed his homely face,
and a pair of blue eyes that seemed young in their innocence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
compared to the world-knowledge that his face betrayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the horses down there to the crick and water
&#8217;em,&#8221; Tim directed his new herder, &#8220;and then you&#8217;ll ride
back with me as far as Joan&#8217;s camp and fetch over some
grub to hold you two fellers till the wagon comes. Joan,
she&#8217;ll know what to give you, and I guess you can find
your way back here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know,&#8221; said Earl, with easy confidence,
riding off to water the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;That kid&#8217;s no stranger to the range,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, more to himself than to Tim, as he watched him
ride off.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he used to be around with the cowboys on Malcolm&#8217;s
ranch when he was in the cattle business. He can
handle a horse as good as you or me. Malcolm was the
man that set me up in the sheep business; I started in
with him like you&#8217;re startin&#8217; with me, more than thirty
years ago. He was the first sheepman on this range,
and he had to fight to hold his own, I&#8217;m here to say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better send the kid over into peaceful territory,&#8221;
Mackenzie suggested, crabbedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the old man wants him to get a taste of what he
went through to make his start&ndash;&ndash;he was tickled to the
toes when he heard the way them Hall boys are rarin&#8217;
up and you standin&#8217; &#8217;em off of this range of mine. &#8216;Send
him over there with that man,&#8217; he says; &#8216;that&#8217;s the kind
of a man I want him to break in under.&#8217; The old feller
was tickled clean to his toes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he over at the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he went back home last night. Come down to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
start the kid right, and talk it over with me. It was all
a surprise to me, I didn&#8217;t know a thing about it, but I
couldn&#8217;t turn Malcolm down.&#8221; Tim winked, looked
cunning, nodded in a knowing way. &#8220;Kid&#8217;s been cuttin&#8217;
up throwin&#8217; away too much money; gettin&#8217; into scrapes
like a boy in town will, you know. Wild oats and a big
crop of &#8217;em. The old man&#8217;s staked him out with me
for three years, and he ain&#8217;t to draw one cent of pay,
or have one cent to spend, in that time. If he breaks
over, it&#8217;s all off between them two. And the kid&#8217;s sole
heir to nearly half a million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie turned to look again at the boy, who was
coming back with the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;ll stick?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he promised the old man he would, and if he&#8217;s
anything like Malcolm, he&#8217;ll eat fire before he&#8217;ll break
his word. Malcolm and me we come to terms in ten
words. The kid&#8217;s to work three years for me without
pay; then I&#8217;ll marry him to my Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt his blood come up hot, and sink down
again, cold; felt his heart kick in one resentful surge,
then fall away to weakness as if its cords had been cut.
Tim laughed, looking down the draw toward the sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something like that Jacob and Laban deal you
spoke about the other day,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Curious how
things come around that way, ain&#8217;t it? There I went
ridin&#8217; off, rakin&#8217; up my brains to remember that story,
and laughed when it come to me all of a sudden. Jacob
skinned them willow sticks, and skinned the old man,
too. But I don&#8217;t guess Earl would turn a trick like
that on me, even if he could.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How about Joan? Does she agree to the terms?&#8221;
Mackenzie could not forbear the question, even though
his throat was dry, his lips cold, his voice husky at the
first word.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll jump at it,&#8221; Tim declared, warmly. &#8220;She
wants to go away from here and see the world, and this
will be her chance. I don&#8217;t object to her leavin&#8217;, either,
as long as it don&#8217;t cost me anything. You go ahead
and stuff her, John; stuff her as full of learnin&#8217; as
she&#8217;ll hold. It&#8217;ll be cheaper for me than sendin&#8217; her off
to school and fittin&#8217; her up to be a rich man&#8217;s wife, and
you can do her just as much good&ndash;&ndash;more, from what she
tells me. You go right ahead and stuff her, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl, he&#8217;ll look after your sheep while you&#8217;re teachin&#8217;
Joan her books. Stuff her, but don&#8217;t founder her,
John. If any man can fit her up to prance in high
society, I&#8217;d bet my last dollar you can. You&#8217;re a kind
of a gentleman yourself, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said John, grinning a dry grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; reminiscently, with great satisfaction, &#8220;Malcolm
made the proposition to me, hit me with it so sudden
it nearly took my breath. &#8216;Marry him to your
Joan when you make a man of him,&#8217; he says. I said
maybe he wouldn&#8217;t want to hitch up with a sheepman&#8217;s
daughter that was brought up on the range. &#8216;If he
don&#8217;t he can go to work and make his own way&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll not
leave him a dam&#8217; cent!&#8217; says Malcolm. We shook hands
on it; he said he&#8217;d put it in his will. And that&#8217;s cinched
so it can&#8217;t slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Tim mounted to leave he looked round the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
range again with a drawing of trouble in his face, as if
he searched the peaceful landscape for the shadow of
wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got another sheep-wagon to give you right
now, John; I guess you&#8217;ll have to make out with a
tent till winter,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have it,&#8221; Mackenzie replied.</p>
<p>Tim leaned over, hand to one side of his mouth,
speaking in low voice, yet not whispering:</p>
<p>&#8220;And remember what I said about that matter, John.
Stuff, but don&#8217;t founder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuff,&#8221; said John, but with an inflection that gave
the word a different meaning, quite.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A FIGHT ALMOST LOST</h3>
</div>
<p>Dad Frazer was not overly friendly toward the
young man from Omaha who had come out to
learn the sheep business under the threat of penalties
and the promise of high rewards. He growled around
about him continually when he and Mackenzie met,
which was not very often, owing to their being several
miles apart. Tim had stationed Dad and his big band
of sheep between Mackenzie and Joan, leaving the
schoolmaster to hold the frontier. No matter for old
man Reid&#8217;s keenness to have his son suffer some of the
dangers which he had faced in his day, Tim seemed to
be holding the youth back out of harm&#8217;s way, taking no
risks on losing a good thing for the family.</p>
<p>Reid had been on the range about two weeks, but Mackenzie
had not seen a great deal of him, owing to Tim&#8217;s
plan of keeping him out of the disputed territory, especially
at night. That the young man did not care
much for the company or instruction of Dad Frazer was
plain. Twice he had asked Mackenzie to use his influence
with Tim to bring about a change from the old
man&#8217;s camp to his. In Mackenzie&#8217;s silence and severity
the young man found something that he could not penetrate,
a story that he could not read. Perhaps it was
with a view to finding out what school Mackenzie had
been seasoned in that Reid bent himself to win his friendship.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Dad Frazer came over the hills to Mackenzie&#8217;s range
that afternoon, to stretch his legs, he said, although
Mackenzie knew it was to stretch his tongue, caring
nothing for the miles that lay between. He had left
Reid in charge of his flock, the young man being favored
by Tim to the extent of allowing him a horse, the same
as he did Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he takes to you,&#8221; said Dad. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
him; he&#8217;s got a graveyard in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he ever pulled a gun on anybody in his
life, Dad,&#8221; Mackenzie returned, in mild amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that kind of a graveyard; I mean a
graveyard where he buried the boy in him long before
his time. He&#8217;s too sharp for his years; he&#8217;s seen too
much of the kind of life a young feller&#8217;s better off for to
hear about from a distance and never touch. I tell you,
John, he ain&#8217;t no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an agreeable kind of a chap, anyhow; he&#8217;s got a
line of talk like a saddle salesman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I never did have no use for a talkin&#8217; man.
Nothin&#8217; to &#8217;em; they don&#8217;t stand the gaff.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of his friendly defense of young Reid, Mackenzie
felt that Dad had read him aright. There was
something of subtle knowledge, an edge of guile showing
through his easy nature and desire to please, that
was like acid on the teeth. Reid had the faculty of
making himself agreeable, and he was an apt and willing
hand, but back of this ingenuous appearance there
seemed to be something elusive and shadowy, a thing
which he tried to keep hidden by nimble maneuvers, but
which would show at times for all his care.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie did not dislike the youth, but he found it
impossible to warm up to him as one man might to
another in a place where human companionship is a
luxury. When Reid sat with a cigarette in his thin
lips&ndash;&ndash;it was a wide mouth, worldly hard&ndash;&ndash;hazy in abstraction
and smoke, there came a glaze over the clearness
of his eyes, a look of dead harshness, a cast of
cunning. In such moments his true nature seemed to
express itself unconsciously, and Dad Frazer, simple as
he was in many ways, was worldly man enough to penetrate
the smoke, and sound the apprentice sheepman to
his soul.</p>
<p>Reid seemed to draw a good deal of amusement out of
his situation under Tim Sullivan. He was dependent
on the flockmaster for his clothing and keep, even tobacco
and papers for his cigarettes. If he knew anything
about the arrangement between his father and
Sullivan in regard to Joan, he did not mention it. That
he knew it, Mackenzie fully believed, for Tim Sullivan
was not the man to keep the reward sequestered.</p>
<p>Whether Reid looked toward Joan as adequate compensation
for three years&#8217; exile in the sheeplands, there
was no telling. Perhaps he did not think much of her in
comparison with the exotic plants of the atmosphere he
had left; more than likely there was a girl in the background
somewhere, around whom some of the old man&#8217;s
anxiety to save the lad revolved. Mackenzie hoped to
the deepest cranny of his heart that it was so.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to get a good deal of humor out of working
here for his board and tobacco,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he blatters a good deal about it,&#8221; said Dad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll take another biscuit on Tim Sullivan,&#8217; he says,
and &#8216;here goes another smoke on Tim.&#8217; I don&#8217;t see
where he&#8217;s got any call to make a joke out of eatin&#8217; another
man&#8217;s bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s never eaten any man&#8217;s bread outside of
the family before, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he wouldn&#8217;t have to be doin&#8217; it now if he&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; been decent. Oh well, maybe he ain&#8217;t so bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>This day Dad was maneuvering around to unload the
apprentice on Mackenzie for good. He worked up to it
gradually, as if feeling his way with his good foot ahead,
careful not to be too sudden and plunge into a hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like a feller around that talks so much,&#8221; Dad
complained. &#8220;When he&#8217;s around a man ain&#8217;t got no
time to think and plan and lay his projec&#8217;s for what he&#8217;s
a goin&#8217; to do. All I can do to put a word in edgeways
once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>It appeared plain enough that Dad&#8217;s sore spot was
this very inability to land as many words as he thought
he had a right to. That is the complaint of any talkative
person. If you are a good listener, with a <i>yes</i> and
a <i>no</i> now and then, a talkative man will tell your friends
you are the most interesting conversationalist he ever
met.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind him,&#8221; Mackenzie said, knowing very
well that Dad would soon be so hungry for somebody
to unload his words upon that he would be talking to the
sheep. &#8220;Ship him over to me when you&#8217;re tired of him;
I&#8217;ll work some of the wind out of him inside of a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him this evenin&#8217;,&#8221; said Dad, eager in his relief,
brightening like an uncovered coal. &#8220;Them dogs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Joan give you&#8217;s breakin&#8217; in to the sound of your voice
wonderful, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re getting used to me slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny about dogs a woman&#8217;s been runnin&#8217; sheep
with. Mighty unusual they&#8217;ll take up with a man after
that. I used to be married to a Indian woman up on
the Big Wind that was some hummer trainin&#8217; sheep-dogs.
That woman could sell &#8217;em for a hundred dollars
apiece as fast as she could raise &#8217;em and train &#8217;em up,
and them dad-splashed collies they&#8217;d purt&#8217; near all come
back home after she&#8217;d sold &#8217;em. Say, I&#8217;ve knowed them
dogs to come back a hundred and eighty mile!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That must have been a valuable woman to have
around a man&#8217;s camp. Where is she now, if I&#8217;m not too
curious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a good woman, one of the best women I
ever had.&#8221; Dad rubbed his chin, eyes reflectively on the
ground, stood silent a spell that was pretty long for
him. &#8220;I hated like snakes to lose that woman&ndash;&ndash;her
name was Little Handful Of Rabbit Hair On A Rock.
Ye-es. She was a hummer on sheep-dogs, all right. She
took a swig too many out of my jug one day and
tripped over a stick and tumbled into the hog-scaldin&#8217;
tank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a miserable end!&#8221; said Mackenzie, shocked by
the old man&#8217;s indifferent way of telling it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it didn&#8217;t hurt her much,&#8221; said Dad. &#8220;Scalded
one side of her till she peeled off and turned white. I
couldn&#8217;t stand her after that. You know a man don&#8217;t
want to be goin&#8217; around with no pinto woman, John.&#8221;
Dad looked up with a gesture of depreciation, a queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
look of apology in his weather-beaten face. &#8220;She was a
Crow,&#8221; he added, as if that explained much that he had
not told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black; nearly as black as a nigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Handful, and so forth, must have thought you
gave her a pretty hard deal, anyhow, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never called her by her full name,&#8221; Dad reflected,
passing over the moral question that Mackenzie raised.
&#8220;I shortened her down to Rabbit. I sure wish I had a
couple of them sheep-dogs of her&#8217;n to give you in place
of them you lost. Joan&#8217;s a good little girl, but she can&#8217;t
train a dog like Rabbit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rabbit&#8217;s still up there on the Big Wind waiting for
you, is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll wait a long time! I&#8217;m done with Indians. Joan
comin&#8217; over today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess you&#8217;ll have her to bother with much
longer&ndash;&ndash;her and that Reid boy they&#8217;ll be hitchin&#8217; up one
of these days from all the signs. He skirmishes off over
that way nearly every day. Looks to me like Tim laid
it out that way, givin&#8217; him a horse to ride and leavin&#8217;
me and you to hoof it. It&#8217;d suit Tim, all right; I&#8217;ve
heard old Reid&#8217;s a millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it would,&#8221; Mackenzie said, trying to keep his
voice from sounding as cold as his heart felt that
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think they&#8217;ll hitch. Well, I&#8217;d like to see Joan
land a better man than him. I don&#8217;t like a man that
can draw a blinder over his eyes like a frog.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie smiled at the aptness of Dad&#8217;s comparison.
It was, indeed, as if Reid interposed a film like a frog
when he plunged from one element into another, so to
speak; when he left the sheeplands in his thoughts and
went back to the haunts and the companions lately
known.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Joan had a little more meat on her she wouldn&#8217;t
be a bad looker,&#8221; said Dad. &#8220;Well, when a man&#8217;s young
he likes &#8217;em slim, and when he&#8217;s old he wants &#8217;em fat.
It&#8217;d be a calamity if a man was to marry a skinny girl
like Joan and she was to stay skinny all his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s exactly skinny, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon you could count her ribs. But
you put fifty pounds more on that girl and see how she&#8217;d
look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine it,&#8221; said Mackenzie, not friendly to
the notion at all.</p>
<p>As Dad went back to unburden himself of his unwelcome
companion, Mackenzie could not suppress the
thought that a good many unworthy notions hatched
beneath that dignified white hair. But surely Dad
might be excused by a more stringent moralist than the
schoolmaster for abandoning poor Rabbit after her
complexion had suffered in the hog-scalding vat.</p>
<p>Toward sundown Earl Reid came riding over, his
winning smile as easy on his face as he was in the saddle.
The days were doing him good, all around, toughening
his face, taking the poolroom pastiness out of it, putting
a bracer in his back. Mackenzie noted the improvement
as readily as it could be seen in some quick-growing
plant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie was living a very primitive and satisfactory
life under a few yards of tent canvas since the loss
of his wagon. He stretched it over such bushes as came
handy, storing his food beneath it when he slept, save on
such nights as threatened showers. Reid applauded this
arrangement. He was tired of Dad Frazer&#8217;s wagon,
and the greasy bunk in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wild to stretch out in a blanket with my
feet to a little fire,&#8221; he said, with a flash of the eagerness
belonging to the boyhood buried away too soon, as Dad
had remarked. &#8220;Dad wouldn&#8217;t let me do it&ndash;&ndash;fussed at
me three days because I sneaked out on him one night
and laid under the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad didn&#8217;t want a skunk to bite you, I guess. He
felt a heavy responsibility on your account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old snoozer!&#8221; said Reid.</p>
<p>Reid was uncommonly handy as a camp-cook, far
better in that respect than Mackenzie, who gladly
turned the kitchen duties over to him and let him have
his way. After supper they sat talking, the lusty moon
lifting a wondering face over the hills in genial placidity
as if sure, after all its ages, of giving the world a surprise
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan told me to bring you word she&#8217;d be over in the
morning instead of tomorrow afternoon,&#8221; said Reid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid smoked in reflective silence, his thin face clear
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some girl,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why she wants to
go to all this trouble to get a little education. That
stuff&#8217;s all bunk. I wish I had the coin in my jeans right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
now the old man spent on me, pourin&#8217; stuff into me that
went right on through like smoke through a handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be that way with Joan,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, hoping Reid would drop the discussion
there, and not go into the arrangement for the future,
which was a matter altogether detestable in the schoolmaster&#8217;s
thoughts.</p>
<p>Reid did not pursue his speculations on Joan, whether
through delicacy or indifference Mackenzie could not
tell. He branched off into talk of other things, through
which the craving for the life he had left came out in
strong expressions of dissatisfaction with the range.
He complained against the penance his father had set,
looking ahead with consternation to the three years he
must spend in those solitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stick,&#8221; he said, an unmistakable determination
in his tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show him they&#8217;re making
as good men now as they did when he was a kid.&#8221; He
laughed, a raucous, short laugh, an old man&#8217;s laugh,
which choked in a cigarette cough and made a mockery
of mirth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll toughen up out here and have better
wind for the big finish when I sit in on the old man&#8217;s
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Joan was not cast for any important part in
young Reid&#8217;s future drama, Mackenzie understood. As
if his thoughts had penetrated to the young man&#8217;s heart,
making fatuous any further attempt at concealment of
his true sentiments, Reid spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve sewed me up in a sack with Joan&ndash;&ndash;I guess
you know about it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Tim was telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A guy could do worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this comforting reflection Reid stretched himself
on his blanket and went to sleep. Mackenzie was
not slow in following his example, for it had been a hard
day with the sheep, with much leg work on account of
the new dogs showing a wolfish shyness of their new
master most exasperating at times. Mackenzie&#8217;s last
thought was that Reid would take a great deal of labor
off his legs by using the horse in attending the sheep.</p>
<p>A scream woke Mackenzie. He heaved up out of his
sleep with confusion clouding his senses for the moment,
the thought that he was on water, and the cry was that
of one who drowned, persistent above his struggling reason.
It was a choking cry, the utterance of a desperate
soul who sees life fleeing while he lifts his voice in the last
appeal. And between him and his companion Mackenzie
saw the bulk of a giant-shouldered man, who bent with
arm outstretched toward him, whose hand came in contact
with his throat as he rose upright with the stare of
confusion in his eyes.</p>
<p>Mackenzie broke through this film of his numbing
sleep, reaching for the rifle that he had laid near his
hand. It was gone, and across the two yards intervening
he saw young Reid writhing in the grip of the monster
who was strangling out his life.</p>
<p>Mackenzie wrenched free from the great hand that
closed about his throat, tearing the mighty arm away
with the strength of both his own. A moment, and he
was involved in the most desperate struggle that he had
ever faced in his life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>This interference gave Reid a new gulp of life. The
three combatants were on their feet now, not a word
spoken, not a sound but the dull impact of blows and
the hard breathings of the two who fought this monster
of the sheeplands for their lives. Swan Carlson,
Mackenzie believed him to be, indulging his insane desire
for strangling out the lives of men. He had approached
so stealthily, with such wild cunning, that the dogs had
given no alarm, and had taken the gun to insure against
miscarriage or interruption in his horrible menu of
death.</p>
<p>A brief tangle of locked arms, swaying bodies, ribs all
but crushed in the embrace of those bestial arms, and
Mackenzie was conscious that he was fighting the battle
alone. In the wild swirl of it he could not see whether
Reid had fallen or torn free. A little while, now in the
pressure of those hairy, bare arms, now free for one
gasping breath, fighting as man never fought in the
sheeplands before that hour, and Mackenzie felt himself
snatched up bodily and thrown down from uplifted arms
with a force that must have ended all for him then but
for the interposition of a sage-clump that broke the fall.</p>
<p>Instantly the silent monster was upon him. Mackenzie
met him hand to hand, fighting the best fight that
was in him, chilled with the belief that it was his last.
But he could not come up from his knees, and in this
position his assailant bent over him, one hand on his
forehead, the other at the back of his neck, a knee
against his breast.</p>
<p>Mackenzie tore at the great, stiff arms with his last
desperate might, perhaps staying a little the pressure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
that in a moment more must snap his spine. As the
assassin tightened this terrible grip Mackenzie&#8217;s face was
lifted toward the sky. Overhead was the moon, clear-edged,
bright, in the dusk of the immensities beyond;
behind the monster, who paused that breath as in design
to fill his victim&#8217;s last moment with a hope that he soon
would mock, Mackenzie saw young Reid.</p>
<p>The youth was close upon the midnight strangler,
stooping low. As the terrible pressure on forehead
and neck cracked his spine like a breaking icicle, Mackenzie
believed he shouted, putting into his voice all that
he felt of desperate need of help. And he saw young
Reid strike, and felt the breaking wrench of the cruel
hands relax, and fell down upon the ground like a dead
man and knew no more.</p>
<p>Reid was there with the lantern, putting water on
Mackenzie&#8217;s head when he again broke through the mists
and followed the thread of his soul back to his body.
Reid was encouraging him to be steady, and to take it
easy, assuring him that he never saw a man put up such
a fight as the schoolmaster had all but lost.</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat up presently, with throbbing head, a
feeling of bulging in his eyeballs, his neck stiff from the
wrenching it had received. The great body of the man
whom he had fought lay stretched in the moonlight, face
to the ground. The camp butcher knife was sticking in
his back. Mackenzie got to his feet, a dizziness over
him, but a sense of his obligation as clear as it ever was
in any man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe you one for that; I&#8217;ll not forget it in a hurry,&#8221;
he said, giving Reid his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re even on it,&#8221; Reid returned. &#8220;He&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
broke my neck in another second if you hadn&#8217;t made
that tackle. Who is he, do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn him over,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>Reid withdrew the knife, sticking it into the ground
with as little concern as if he had taken it from a
butcher&#8217;s block, and heaved the fellow over on his back.
The moonlight revealed his dusty features clearly, but
Mackenzie brought the lantern to make it doubly sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not the man I thought he was,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
think this fellow&#8217;s name is Matt Hall. He&#8217;s the sheep-killer
you&#8217;ve heard about. Look&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s all over blood&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
wool on his shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt Hall, huh?&#8221; said Reid. He wiped the butcher
knife on the dead sheep-killer&#8217;s shirt, making a little
whistling, reflective sound through his teeth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
to scour that knife before we cut bacon with it in the
morning,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE LONESOMENESS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the lonesomeness,&#8221; said Dad, &#8220;and I tell
you, John, when that gits a hold of a man he
ain&#8217;t responsible. It&#8217;s the same as shuttin&#8217; a man up in
jail to break him off of booze&ndash;&ndash;say, he&#8217;ll claw the rocks
out of the wall with his finger nails to git out where he
can take a snort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had the lonesomeness, so I don&#8217;t know, but
there&#8217;s something the matter with the kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see him tearin&#8217; around the country ridin&#8217; the
head off of that horse, never lookin&#8217; where he&#8217;s goin&#8217;
any more than a bat. He&#8217;s been clean over to Four Corners
after the mail twice this week. A feller must want
a letter purty bad when he&#8217;ll go to all that fuss for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to be hard for him; he hasn&#8217;t
any more than bitten into his three years yet; he don&#8217;t
really know how they taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll break him; he&#8217;ll go all to pieces, I tell you John.
When the lonesomeness takes a hold of a feller that way
something pops in his head after a while; then he either
puts a bullet through his heart or settles down and gits
fat. That feller ain&#8217;t got it in him to put on loco fat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad had slicked himself up pretty well that day before
cutting across the range for a chat with Mackenzie.
His operations with the sheep-shears on his fuzzy
whiskers had not been uniform, probably due to the lack
of a mirror. Dad trusted to the feel of it when he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
no water by to look into and guide his hand, and this
time he had cut close to the skin in several places, displaying
his native color beneath the beard. But whatever
he lacked in his chin-hedge he made up for in careful
arrangement of his truly beautiful hair.</p>
<p>There was a sniff of perfume about him, a nosegay of
wild flowers pinned in the pocket of his shirt. Mackenzie
marveled over these refinements in the old man&#8217;s
everyday appearance, but left it to his own time and
way to tell what plans or expectations prompted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector Hall showed up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid wouldn&#8217;t make any more than a snap and a
swaller out of that feller, I guess. But it ain&#8217;t good for
a man like him to start out killin&#8217;; it goes to his liver
too quick and drives him mooney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;s very healthy for any man, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it! I&#8217;ve went fifty miles around a range to
skip a feller that was lookin&#8217; for my skelp, and I&#8217;d go a
thousand before I&#8217;d crowd a fight. I never was much on
the fight, and runnin&#8217; sheep took what little was in me
out a long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad got out his red box of corn-husk cigarettes, offering
it silently to Mackenzie, who shook his head,
knowing very well that Dad did it to observe conventions
rather than out of a desire to have him help himself.
The stock of Mexican smokes was running low;
Dad had spoken of it only the day before, and his feet
were itching for the road to the border, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s got a name and a fame in this country he
can travel on,&#8221; said Dad.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>Which was true enough. Mackenzie&#8217;s fight with Swan
Carlson had taken second place, his reputation as a
fighting man in the sheeplands had paled almost to
nothing, after Reid&#8217;s swift-handed dealing with Matt
Hall. The fame of his exploit ran through the country,
fixing his place in it at once, for Matt Hall was known
as a man who had the strength of seven in his long,
gorilla arms.</p>
<p>Hector Hall, brother of the slain man, seemed to accept
the tragedy with a sorrowful resignation in which
no shadow of revenge appeared. He let it be known
that Matt had been irresponsible at times, given to
night-prowlings and outbreaks of violence of strange
and fantastic forms. How much truth there was in this
excuse for the dead man, Hector alone knew. But no
matter for his passivity, Mackenzie did not trust him.
He made a requisition on Tim Sullivan at once for revolvers
for himself and Reid, which Tim delegated the
young man to go to Four Corners and buy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I come over to see if you&#8217;ll lend Reid to me
three or four days while I make a trip to town,&#8221; said
Dad. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a little business over there to tend to
I&#8217;ve been puttin&#8217; off for more than a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if it&#8217;s all right with Tim you can have him.
What&#8217;s up, getting married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of arrangin&#8217;, John, kind of arrangin&#8217;. There&#8217;s
a widow-lady over at Four Corners I used to rush that
needs a man to help her with her sheep. A man might as
well marry a sheep ranch as work on one, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shorter cut, anyhow. When do you want
Reid?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I was aimin&#8217; to rack out this evenin&#8217;, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him over this afternoon. I don&#8217;t know
where he is, but he&#8217;ll be back for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad went away well satisfied and full of cheer, Mackenzie
marveling over his marital complexities as he
watched him go. Together with Rabbit, and the Mexican
woman down El Paso way whom John had mentioned,
but of whom Dad never had spoken, and no telling
how many more scattered around the country, Dad
seemed to be laying the groundwork for a lively roundup
one of his days. He said he&#8217;d been marrying women
off and on for forty years. His easy plan seemed to be
just to take one that pleased his capricious temper
wherever he found her, without regard to former obligations.</p>
<p>Mackenzie grinned. He did not believe any man was
so obscure as to be able to escape many wives. Dad
seemed to be a dry-land sailor, with a wife in every town
he ever had made in his life. Mackenzie understood about
Mexican marriages. If they were priest marriages, they
were counted good; if they were merely justice of the
peace ones they were subject to wide and elastic infringement
on both sides. Probably Indian marriages
were similar. Surely Dad was old enough to know what
he was about.</p>
<p>Reid came to camp at noontime, and prepared dinner
in his quick and handy way. Mackenzie did not take up
the question of his acting as relief for Dad while the old
scout went off to push his arrangements for marrying
a sheep ranch, seeing that Reid was depressed and down-spirited
and in no pleasant mood.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>They were almost independent of the camp-mover,
owing to their light equipment, which they could carry
with them from day to day as the sheep ranged. Supplies
were all they needed from the wagon, which came
around to them twice a week. After dinner Reid began
packing up for the daily move, moody and silent, cigarette
dangling on his lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a one-hell of a life!&#8221; said he, looking up from
the last knot in the rope about the bundle of tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you soured on it already, Earl?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid sat on the bundle of tent, a cloud on his face,
hat drawn almost to the bridge of his nose, scowling out
over the sheep range as if he would curse it to a greater
barrenness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years of this, and what&#8217;ll I be? Hell! I
can&#8217;t even find that other Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been out looking for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That big Swede over there was tellin&#8217; me he&#8217;s put me
down in his book for a killin&#8217;. I thought I&#8217;d give him a
chance to get it over with if he meant it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Carlson been over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I rode over there the other evening. Say, is
that the woman you found chained up when you struck
this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked at Reid curiously as he answered.
There was something of quick eagerness in the young
man&#8217;s inquiry, a sudden light of a new interest in his
face, in sharp contrast with the black mood of a moment
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks like an Ibsen heroine,&#8221; said Reid. &#8220;Take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
that woman out of this country and dress her right,
and she&#8217;d be a queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep away from there,&#8221; said Mackenzie,
dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I can take care of Swan if you could,&#8221;
Reid returned, with a certain easy insolence, jerking his
hip to hitch his gun around in suggestive movement.</p>
<p>Mackenzie dropped the matter without more words,
seeing too plainly the humor of the youth. Maybe Dad
had diagnosed his ailment aright, but to Mackenzie it
appeared something more than plain lonesomeness. The
notoriety attending the killing of Matt Hall had not
been good for Reid. He wanted more of it, and a bigger
audience, a wider field.</p>
<p>If this was a taste of the adventure of the West&#8217;s
past romantic times, Mackenzie felt that he was lucky
he had come too late to share it. His own affair with
Swan Carlson had been sordid enough, but this unlucky
embroilment in which Reid had killed a man was a plain
misfortune to the hero of the fight. He told Reid of
Dad&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go and run his sheep for him,&#8221; Reid suggested.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll take you a little nearer Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>This he added as with studied sneer, his face flushing
darkly, his thin mouth twisted in an ugly grin.</p>
<p>Mackenzie passed it, but not without the hurt of the
unkind stab showing in his face. It was so entirely
unjustified as to be cruel, for Mackenzie was not in
Reid&#8217;s way even to the extent of one lurking, selfish
thought. Since Reid had saved his life from Matt
Hall&#8217;s murderous hands, Mackenzie had withdrawn even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
his most remote hope in regard to Joan. Before that
he had spun his thread of dreams, quite honestly, and
with intent that he would not have denied, but since,
not at all.</p>
<p>He owed Reid too much to cross him with Joan; he
stepped aside, denying himself a thought of her save
only in relation of teacher and pupil, trying to convince
himself that it was better in the end for Joan.
Reid had all the advantage of him in prospects; he
could lift up the curtain on his day and show Joan the
splendors of a world that a schoolmaster could point
out only from afar. Mackenzie seemed to ignore the
youth&#8217;s suggestion that he go and tend Dad&#8217;s flock.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a thousand dollars I&#8217;d dust it for Mexico
tomorrow,&#8221; said Reid. He turned to Mackenzie, pushing
his hat back from his forehead, letting the sun on
his savagely knotted face. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got money to
send a telegram, not even a special delivery letter!
Look at me! A millionaire&#8217;s son and sole heir, up
against a proposition like this for three years!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie let him sweat it out, offering neither water
for his thirst nor wood for his fire. Reid sat in surly
silence, running his thumb along his cartridge belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s friends forget him out here,&#8221; he complained;
&#8220;he&#8217;s the same to them as dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way everywhere when a man wants to borrow
money,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, not without the shade
of a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve let them have enough in my time that they
could afford to come across with what I asked for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better stick to the sheep business with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Tim,&#8221; Mackenzie advised, not unkindly, ashamed of his
momentary weakness and scorn. &#8220;A man&#8217;s prospects
don&#8217;t look very good back home when a bunch of parasites
and grafters won&#8217;t come over with a little loan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can go to the devil! I can live without them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And get fat on it, kid. Three years here will be
little more to you than as many days, if you get&ndash;&ndash;interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid exclaimed impatiently, dismissing such assurance
with a testy gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will you give me for my chances?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody else can play your hand, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the square, Mackenzie. Will you give me a
thousand dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sole heir to any millionaire,&#8221; Mackenzie
reminded him, taking the proposal in the jesting spirit
that he supposed it was given.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the dead, Mackenzie&ndash;&ndash;I mean it. Will you give
me a thousand dollars for my place in the sheep game,
girl and all? If you will, I&#8217;ll hit the breeze tonight for
Mexico and kick it all over to you, win or lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could buy you out for a dime we couldn&#8217;t trade,&#8221;
Mackenzie told him, a coldness in tone and manner that
was more than a reproof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan ought to be worth that much to you!&#8221; Reid
sneered.</p>
<p>Mackenzie got up, walked a few steps away, turned
back presently, his temper in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question open to discussion between gentlemen,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Reid blinked up at him, an odd leer on his sophisticated
face, saying no more. He made a pack on his
saddle of the camp outfit, and started off along the
ridge, leaving Mackenzie to follow as he pleased. A
mile or more along Reid pitched upon a suitable
camping place. He had himself established long before
Mackenzie came to where he sat smoking amid his
gloomy, impatient thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going over to relieve that old skunk,&#8221; Reid
announced, &#8220;not without orders from Sullivan. If he
gets off you&#8217;ll have to relieve him yourself. I don&#8217;t want
that Hall guy to get it into his nut that I&#8217;m runnin&#8217;
away from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Earl,&#8221; said Mackenzie, good-naturedly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be half an hour nearer Joan&#8217;s camp&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;ll
have that much longer to stay,&#8221; said Reid, his mean leer
creeping into his wide, thin lips again.</p>
<p>Mackenzie turned slowly to look him squarely in the
eyes. He stood so a few seconds, Reid coloring in hot
resentment of the silent rebuke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard enough of that to last me the rest of
your three years,&#8221; Mackenzie said, something as hard
as stones in a cushion under his calm voice.</p>
<p>Reid jerked his hip in his peculiar twisting movement
to shift his pistol belt, turned, and walked away.</p>
<p>If it was the lonesomeness, Mackenzie thought, it was
taking a mighty peculiar turn in that fellow. He was
more like a cub that was beginning to find itself, and
bristle and snarl and turn to bite the hand that had
fended it through its helpless stage. Perhaps it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
pass in a little while, or perhaps it would get worse on
him. In the latter case there would be no living on the
range with Reid, for on the range Mackenzie believed
Reid was destined to remain. He had been trying to
borrow money to get away, with what view in his dissatisfied
head Mackenzie could not guess. He hadn&#8217;t
got it; he wouldn&#8217;t get it. Those who had fattened
on him in his prosperity were strangers to him in his
time of penance and disgrace.</p>
<p>Mackenzie put off his start to Dad&#8217;s camp until dusk,
knowing the old man would prefer to take the road at
night, after his mysterious way. He probably would
hoof it over to Sullivan&#8217;s and borrow a buckboard to
make a figure in before the widow-lady upon whom he
had anchored his variable heart.</p>
<p>Reid was bringing in the sheep when Mackenzie left,
too far away for a word. Mackenzie thought of going
down to him, for he disliked to part with anything like
a shadow between them, feeling that he owed Reid a
great debt indeed. More than that, he liked the kid, for
there seemed to be a streak of good in him that all his
ugly moods could not cover. But he went his way over
the hills toward Dad&#8217;s camp, the thought persisting in
him that he would, indeed, be thirty minutes nearer
Joan. And it was a thought that made his heart jump
and a gladness burn in his eyes, and his feet move onward
with a swift eagerness.</p>
<p>But only as a teacher with a lively interest in his
pupil, he said; only that, and nothing more. On a
hilltop a little way beyond his camp he stopped suddenly,
his breath held to listen. Over the calm, far-carrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
silence of the early night there came the sound
of a woman singing, and this was the manner of her
song:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Na-a-fer a-lo-o-one, na-a-fer a-lone.<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>ONLY ONE JACOB</h3>
</div>
<p>Joan came riding over the next morning from Reid&#8217;s
camp, not having heard of Mackenzie&#8217;s shift to
oblige Dad Frazer. She was bareheaded, the sun in her
warm hair, hat hanging on her saddle-horn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad might have come by and told me,&#8221; she said,
flinging to the ground as lightly as a swallow. &#8220;It
would have saved us half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to work harder to make it up,&#8221; Mackenzie
told her, thinking how much more a woman she was
growing every day.</p>
<p>Joan was distrait again that day, her eyes fixed often
in dreamy speculation as her teacher explained something
that she found hard, against her wonted aptness,
to understand. When the rather disjointed lesson came
to an end Joan sighed, strapping her books in a way
that seemed to tell that she was weary of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you still think you&#8217;ll stick to the sheep business,
John?&#8221; she asked, not lifting her eyes to his face, all
out of her frank and earnest way of questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only on probation, you know, Joan; something
might happen between now and this time next year to
change things all around. There&#8217;s a chance, anyhow,
that I may not make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing will ever happen to change it,&#8221; said
Joan, shaking her head sadly. &#8220;Nothing that ought to
happen ever happens here. I don&#8217;t know whether I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
stand it to carry out my contract with dad or not.
Three years between me and what I&#8217;m longing for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very long when one&#8217;s young, Joan. Well,
I don&#8217;t know of any short cuts to either fame or fortune,
or I&#8217;d have taken them myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you&#8217;re free to pick up and go whenever you
want to. A man don&#8217;t have to have money to strike out
and see the world&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t see why a woman should. I
could work my way as well as anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re harder masters out there than the range is
to you here, Joan. And there&#8217;s the insolence of mastery,
and the obloquy of poverty and situation that I
hope you&#8217;ll never feel. Wait a little while longer with
the probationers among the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl never will stay it out,&#8221; she said, lifting her eyes
for a moment to his. &#8220;He&#8217;s sick of it now&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d throw
everything over if he had the money to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be a very foolish young man, then. But it&#8217;s
like breaking off smoking, I guess, to quit the things
you&#8217;ve grown up with on short notice like he had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe in about a year more my interest will amount
to enough to let me out,&#8221; said Joan, pursuing her
thought of winning to freedom in the way she had
elected. She seemed innocent of any knowledge of the
arrangement whereby Earl Reid was working for his
reward. Mackenzie wondered if it could be so.</p>
<p>&#8220;If dad&#8217;ll buy me out then,&#8221; she said, speculatively,
doubtfully, carrying on her thought in a disjointed way.
&#8220;It would be like him to turn me down, though, if I want
to quit before my time&#8217;s up. And he wouldn&#8217;t let me
divide the sheep and sell my share to anybody else.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>No, Joan could not yet know of Tim&#8217;s arrangement
with Earl Reid&#8217;s father. It would be like Tim, indeed,
to bargain her off without considering her in the matter
at all. To a man like Tim his sons and daughters were
as much his chattels as his sheep, kind as he was in his
way. The apprenticeship of Joan to the range was
proof of that. Somewhere out in that gray loneliness
two younger daughters were running sheep, with little
brothers as protectors and companions, beginning their
adventures and lessons in the only school they were
ever likely to know.</p>
<p>Tim made a great virtue of the fact that he had
taught all of them to read and write. That much
would serve most of them satisfactorily for a few years,
but Mackenzie grinned his dry grin to himself when
he thought of the noise there would be one day in Tim
Sullivan&#8217;s cote when the young pigeons shook out their
wings to fly away. It was in the breed to do that; it
looked out of the eyes of every one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent and got a Bible from the mail-order house,&#8221;
said Joan, looking up with lively eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it come already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley got it yesterday. I found that story about
Jacob and Rachel and the weak-eyed girl. It&#8217;s awful
short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it tells a good deal, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan seemed thinking over how much the short story
really told, her eyes far away on the elusive, ever-receding
blue curtain that was down between her and the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it tells a lot,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;But Jake must not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
have been very bright. Well, he was a cowman, anyhow;
he wasn&#8217;t running sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he went into the sheep business afterwards,&#8221;
Mackenzie said, diverted by her original comment on
the old tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when his girls got big enough to do the work!&#8221;
The resentment of her hard years was in Joan&#8217;s voice,
the hardness of unforgiving regret for all that had been
taken from her life.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt a sweep of depression engulf him like
a leaping wave. Joan was in the humor to profit by
any arrangement that would break her bondage to
sheep; Tim Sullivan had been bringing her up, unconsciously,
but none the less effectively, to fit into this
scheme for marrying her to his old friend&#8217;s rakish son.
When the day came for Joan to know of the arrangement,
she would leap toward it as toward an open door.</p>
<p>Still, it should not concern him. Once he had believed
there was a budding blossom on his hitherto dry branch
of romance; if he had been so ungenerous as to take
advantage of Joan&#8217;s loneliness and urge the promise to
florescence, they might have been riding down out of
the sheeplands together that day.</p>
<p>It would have been a venture, too, he admitted. For
contact with the world of men must prove a woman,
even as the hardships of the range must prove a man.
Perhaps the unlimited variety displayed before her eyes
would have made Joan dissatisfied with her plain choice.</p>
<p>At that moment it came to him that perhaps Joan
was to be tested and proved here, even as he was being
tested in Tim Sullivan&#8217;s balance for his fitness to become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
a master over sheep. Here were two fair samples of
men out of the world&#8217;s assorted stock&ndash;&ndash;himself and
Reid. One of them, deliberate, calm, assured of his
way, but with little in his hand; the other a grig that
could reel and spin in the night-lights, and flutter to
a merry tune.</p>
<p>With Mackenzie the rewards of life would come to her
slowly, but with a sweet savor of full understanding and
appreciation as they were won. Many of them most
desired might never be attained; many more might be
touched and withdrawn in the mockery that fate practices
so heartlessly upon men. Reid could convey her
at once over the rough summits which men and women
wear their hearts threadbare to attain. With Reid the
journey would begin where, with the best hoping, it
must in his own company almost end.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unlucky for Earl that he killed Matt Hall,&#8221;
said Joan, taking up another thread of thought in her
discursive, unfixed humor of that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate for any man to have to kill another,
I guess. But it has to be done sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt deserved it, all right&ndash;&ndash;he ought have been
killed for his mean face long ago&ndash;&ndash;but it&#8217;s turned Earl&#8217;s
head, haven&#8217;t you noticed? He thinks he&#8217;s got one foot
on each side of this range, herdin&#8217; everybody between
his legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get over it in a little while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not got brains enough to hold him down when
the high winds begin to blow. If he&#8217;s a fair sample of
what they&#8217;ve got in Omaha, I&#8217;ll cross it off my map
when I begin to travel.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dad says he&#8217;s got the lonesomeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More of the cussedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words warmed Mackenzie like a precious cordial.
At every one of them in derogation of Reid his heart
jumped, seeming to move him by its tremendous vibration
a little nearer to her. He felt that it was traitorous
exultation at the expense of one who had befriended
him to a limit beyond which it is hard for a man to
go, but he could not drown the exhilaration of a reborn
hope in even the deepest waters of his gratitude.</p>
<p>Somebody ought to tell Joan what they had designed
for her in company with Earl Reid; somebody ought to
tell her, but it was not his place. It was strange that
she had read the young man&#8217;s weakness so readily.
Mackenzie had noted more than once before in his life
that those who live nearest to nature are the most apt
in reading all her works.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never stay here through a winter,&#8221; Joan predicted,
with certainty that admitted no argument. &#8220;Give
him a touch of twenty-two below, and a snow on a high
wind, and send him out to bed down the sheep where it&#8217;ll
blow over them! I can see him right now. You&#8217;ll do it,
all right, and I&#8217;ll have to, like I have done many a time.
But we&#8217;re not like Earl. Earl&#8217;s got summer blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie took her hand, feeling it tremble a little,
seeing her face grow pale. The sun was red on the hill,
the sheep were throwing long shadows down the slope
as they grazed lazily, some of them standing on knees
to crop the lush bunch grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Joan, you and I are of different blood,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We are of the blood of the lonesome places, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
we&#8217;ll turn back to them always from our wandering and
seeking contentment among the press of men. He can&#8217;t
have you&ndash;&ndash;Earl Reid can&#8217;t have you&ndash;&ndash;ever in this
world!&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was out, and from his own mouth, and all his
reserve was nothing, and his silent pledging but as an
idle word. Joan was looking at him with wide and
serious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl Reid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl Reid,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;d be a coward to give
you up to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan was not trembling now. She put her free hand
over Mackenzie&#8217;s where it gripped her fingers so hard
that Earl Reid might have been on the opposite side
of her, trying to rive her away from him by force; she
looked up into his eyes and smiled. And there were
flecks of golden brown in Joan&#8217;s eyes, like flakes of
metal from her rich hair. They seemed to increase, and
to sparkle like jewels struck through placid water by
strong sunbeams as she looked up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought dad had made some kind of a deal with
him,&#8221; she said, nodding in her wise way, a truant strand
of hair on her calm forehead. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t tell me
anything, but I knew from the way dad looked at me
out of the corners of his eyes that he had a trade of
some kind on. Tell me about it, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no explanation left to Mackenzie but the
degrading truth, and he gave it to her as Tim Sullivan
had given it to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had their nerve!&#8221; said Joan, flushed with resentment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all off, as far as it affects you and me,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, fetching his brows together in a frown of
denial. &#8220;Reid can&#8217;t have you, not even if he comes into
two million when the old man dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joan softly, her hand stroking his, her
eyes downcast, the glow of the new-old dawn upon her
cheek; &#8220;there&#8217;s only room for one Jacob on this range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I owed it to Reid, as a matter of honor
between men, to step aside and let him have you, according
to the plan. But that was a mistake. A man can&#8217;t
pay his debts by robbing his heart that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw something was holding you back, John,&#8221; said
the wise Joan.</p>
<p>Mackenzie started as if she had thrust him with a
needle, felt his telltale blood flare red in his face, but
grinned a little as he turned to her, meeting her eye
to eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you saw through me, did you, Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you called me Rachel that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I nearly told you that time,&#8221; he sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have, John,&#8221; said she, a bit accusingly;
&#8220;you didn&#8217;t owe him anything then&ndash;&ndash;that was before
he came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I respected you too much to take advantage of your
coming to me that way for your lessons day by day,
Joan. I had to fight to keep it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to pull it out of you,&#8221; Joan said, as serious
as a penitent, although there was a smile breaking on
her lips as she turned her face away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never want to do anything, or say anything, that
would lower your respect for me one little degree, Joan,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
he said, still clinging to her hand as though he feared
he had not quite won her, and must hold her fast by his
side for the final word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you wouldn&#8217;t, John,&#8221; said she, her voice
shaking a little, and low beneath her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;go as far as Jacob went
that first time he saw Rachel,&#8221; said he in desperation,
his grip tightening on her fingers, sweat bursting on
his brow. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d <i>want</i> to, all right,
but I wouldn&#8217;t even&ndash;&ndash;even&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan looked up at him with calm, placid eyes, with
pale cheeks, with yearning lips, a flutter in her heart
that made her weak. She nodded, anxious to help him
to his climax, but not bold, not bolder than himself,
indeed, and he was shaking like a sick man in the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless I could make it holy, unless you could understand
it so, I wouldn&#8217;t even&ndash;&ndash;I wouldn&#8217;t so much as&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He took her face between his hands, and bent over her,
and a glad little sob trembled between Joan&#8217;s lips as
she rested her hands on his shoulders for the benediction
of his kiss.</p>
<p>Joan did not stay to help him bring in the sheep that
day, for there was nothing left for her to wonder over,
or stand wistfully by her saddle waiting to receive.
Neither was there any sound of weeping as she rode up
the hill, for the male custom of expressing joy in that
way had gone out of fashion on the sheep ranges of this
world long before John Mackenzie&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Nothing that he could owe a man could equal what
he had gained that hour, Mackenzie thought, standing
there with heart as light as the down of cottonwood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
With his great debt paid to Earl Reid, even to the
measure of his own life, he would still leave the world
a rich man. He had come into the fresh pastures of
romance at last.</p>
<p>Joan waved him good-bye from the hilltop and went
on, the understanding of his fortune growing on him as
he recalled her eyes in that moment when she closed
them to his salute upon her lips. She gave up that first
kiss that she ever had yielded to any man as though he
had reached down and plucked it out of her heart.</p>
<p>Let them go on planning for years of labor, let them
go on scheming for inheritances, and piece their broken
arrangements together as they might when they found
he had swept Joan out of their squalid calculations as
a rider stoops and lifts a kerchief from the ground.
There would be bitterness and protestations, and rifts
in his own bright hopes, as well.</p>
<p>But if Tim Sullivan would not give her up to him
with the good grace of a man, Mackenzie said, smiling
and smiling like a daft musician, he would take her from
both of them and ride away with her into the valleys
of the world which she was so hungry in her young heart
to behold.</p>
<p>He rounded his sheep to their hillside, and made his
fire, a song in his heart, but his lips sealed, for he was
a silent man. And at dusk there came riding into his
camp a man, whose coat was at his cantle, who was
belted with pistols, who roved his eye with cautious look
as he halted and gave the shepherd good evening. Mackenzie
invited him down to the hospitality of the camp,
which the stranger accepted with hearty grace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I was lookin&#8217; for a young feller by the name of
Reid; you&#8217;re not the man,&#8221; the stranger said with finality,
after one more shrewd look into Mackenzie&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Mackenzie&ndash;&ndash;Reid&#8217;s running a band of
sheep for the same outfit about five miles east of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger said nothing more, being busy at that
moment unsaddling his horse, which he hobbled and
turned to graze. He came over to the fire where Mackenzie
was baking biscuits in a tilted pan, and sat down,
dusty from his day&#8217;s ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the sheriff of this county,&#8221; he announced, not
going into the detail of his name. Mackenzie nodded
his acknowledgment, the sheriff keeping his hungry eye
on the pan. &#8220;I took a cut across here from servin&#8217; some
subpoenas in a murder case on some fellers up on Farewell
Creek,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;to see how that feller Reid&#8217;s
behavin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard any complaint,&#8221; Mackenzie told him,
wondering why this official interest. The sheriff seemed
satisfied with what he heard, and made no further inquiry
or explanation until after he had eaten his supper.
As he smoked a cracked cigar which he took from the
pocket of his ornate vest, he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anything about that boy when Sullivan
put him in here on the range,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the
other day I got a letter from the sheriff in Omaha
askin&#8217; me to keep my eye on him. The news of Reid&#8217;s
killin&#8217; Matt Hall got over to Omaha. You know Reid,
he&#8217;s under sentence of three years in the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Daddy got him paroled to Sullivan&#8217;s sheep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
ranch to serve it. If he breaks over here he goes to the
pen. That&#8217;s the way <i>he</i> stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, he&#8217;ll more than likely stay it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will if he&#8217;s wise. He&#8217;s been a kind of a streak
of wildness, the sheriff in Omaha said. Sent me his full
history, three pages. Married somebody a year or so
ago, but the old man got him out of that by buyin&#8217; off
the girl. Then he started out forgin&#8217;, and pushed it so
hard the old man refused to make good any more. But
he didn&#8217;t want to see the kid go to the pen, and he&#8217;s
here. I got to keep my eye on him to see he don&#8217;t break
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff stretched out when he had finished his
cigar and went to sleep in a blanket provided by his
host. He was up with dawn, ready to resume his journey.
Mackenzie pressed him to stay for breakfast, but
he said he wanted to make a start before the sun and
reach Sullivan&#8217;s ranch-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Sullivan know how things stand with Reid?&#8221;
Mackenzie inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he must. If he don&#8217;t he soon will. Kind
of watch that feller, will you, and slip me word if he
shows any signs of streakin&#8217; out of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve got my eye full looking after two thousand
sheep. That&#8217;s up to Sullivan, he&#8217;s responsible for Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff turned a sharp look of suspicion on Mackenzie,
but said nothing. He led his horse down to the
little stream for water, and came leading it back, a cast
of disfavor in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bad bunch up in here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you and
Carlson and Hall. If there&#8217;s any more killin&#8217; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
fightin&#8217; up this way I&#8217;ll come in and clean you all out.
Where did you say that feller was at?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie told him again, and he rode off to take
a look at Reid, and put what caution into his ear he
had a mind to give. Mackenzie saw him blend into the
gloom of early morning with a feeling of self-felicitation
on his act of yesterday. He was inspired yesterday when
he took Joan under his protection and laid claim to
her in his own right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>REID BEGINS HIS PLAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Dad Frazer came back after five days, diminished
in facial outline on account of having submitted
his stubble beard to the barber at Four Corners.
In reverse of all speculation on Mackenzie&#8217;s part, this
operation did not improve the old man&#8217;s appearance.
Dad&#8217;s face was one of the kind that are built to carry
a beard; without it his weaknesses were too apparent to
the appraising eye.</p>
<p>Dad made glowing report of his success with the
widow at Four Corners. Preliminaries were smoothed;
he had left the widow wearing his ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll jump the broomstick in about a month from
now,&#8221; Dad said, full of satisfaction for his business
stroke. &#8220;I aim to settle down and quit my roamin&#8217;,
John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your marrying, too, I hope, you old rascal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this one will be my last, I reckon. I don&#8217;t
mind, though; I&#8217;ve had doin&#8217;s enough with women in
my day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she a good looker, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen purtier ones and I&#8217;ve seen uglier ones,
John. No, she ain&#8217;t what you might call stylish, I
guess, but she&#8217;s all right for me. She&#8217;s a little off in
one leg, but not enough to hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a slight blemish in a lady with money in the
bank, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I look at it that way, on the sensible side. Good
looks is all right in a woman, but that ain&#8217;t all a man
needs to make him easy in his mind. Well, she did lose
the sight of her left eye when she was a girl, but she
can see a dollar with the other one further than I can
see a wagon wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No gentleman would stop at the small trifle of an
eye. What else, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing else, only she&#8217;s carryin&#8217; a little more meat
right now than a woman likes to pack around in hot
weather. I don&#8217;t mind that; you know, I like mine fat;
you can&#8217;t get &#8217;em too fat for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you say so. How much does she weigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess close to three hundred, John. If she
was taller, it wouldn&#8217;t show so much on her&ndash;&ndash;she can
walk under my arm. But it&#8217;s surprisin&#8217; how that woman
can git around after them sheep!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad added this hopefully, as if bound to append some
redeeming trait to all her physical defects.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many does she own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About four thousand. Not much of a band, but a
lot more than I ever could lay claim to. She&#8217;s got a
twelve-thousand acre ranch, owns every foot of it, more
than half of it under fence. What do you think of
that? Under fence! Runs them sheep right inside of
that bull-wire fence, John, where no wolf can&#8217;t git at
&#8217;em. There ain&#8217;t no bears down in that part of the
country. Safe? Safer&#8217;n money in the bank, and no
expense of hirin&#8217; a man to run &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like you&#8217;ve landed on a feather bed, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I? What does a man care about a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
hobble, or one eye, or a little chunk of fat, when he can
step into a layout like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you lead her up to the hitching-rack
while you were there? Somebody else is likely to pick
your plum while your back&#8217;s turned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon. She&#8217;s been on the tree quite a
spell; she ain&#8217;t the kind you young fellers want, and the
old ones is most generally married off or in the soldiers&#8217;
home. Well, she&#8217;s got a little cross of Indian and Mexican
in her, anyway; that kind of keeps &#8217;em away, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no trouble to frame a mental picture of Dad&#8217;s
inamorata. Black, squat, squint; a forehead a finger
deep, a voice that would carry a mile. Mackenzie had
seen that cross of Mexican and Indian blood, with a
dash of debased white. They were not the kind that
attracted men outside their own mixed breed, but he
hadn&#8217;t a doubt that this one was plenty good enough,
and handsome enough, for Dad.</p>
<p>Mackenzie left the old man with this new happiness
in his heart, through which a procession of various-hued
women had worn a path during the forty years of his
taking in marriage one month and taking leave the next.
Dad wasn&#8217;t nervous over his prospects, but calm and
calculative, as became his age. Mackenzie went smiling
now and then as he thought of the team the black nondescript
and the old fellow would make.</p>
<p>He found Reid sitting on a hilltop with his face in
his hands, surly and out of sorts, his revolver and belt
on the ground beside him as if he had grown weary of
their weight. He gave a short return to Mackenzie&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
unaffected greeting and interested inquiry into the conduct
of the sheep and the dogs during his absence.</p>
<p>Reid&#8217;s eyes were shot with inflamed veins, as if he had
been sitting all night beside a smoky fire. When Mackenzie
sat near him the wind bore the pollution of
whisky from his breath. Reid made a show of being
at his ease, although the veins in his temples were swollen
in the stress of what must have been a splitting
headache. He rolled a cigarette with nonchalance
almost challenging, and smoked in silence, the corners
of his wide, salamander mouth drawn down in a peculiar
scoffing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that guy told you the whole story,&#8221; he
said at last, lifting his eyes briefly to Mackenzie&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheriff, you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221; impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether he told me all or not, but he
told me plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve passed it on to Joan by now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid faced around, a flush over his thin cheeks, a
scowl in his eyes. He took up his belt; Mackenzie
marked how his hands trembled as he buckled it on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you keep out of it, you damned pedagogue!&#8221;
Reid said, the words bursting from him in vehement
passion. &#8220;This is my game; I&#8217;ll play it without any
more of your interference. You&#8217;ve gone far enough
with her&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve gone too far! Drop it; let her alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie got up. Reid stood facing him, his color
gone now, his face gray. Mackenzie held him a moment
with stern, accusing eyes. Then:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have you been over there spying on me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid passed over the question, leaving Mackenzie to
form his own conclusions. His face flushed a little at
the sting of contempt that Mackenzie put into his
words. He fumbled for a match to light his stub of
cigarette before he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;I played into your hands when I let you go over
there, and you knew I&#8217;d play into them when you proposed
it. But that won&#8217;t happen twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not allow any man to put a deliberately false
construction on my motives, Reid,&#8221; Mackenzie told him,
hotly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t propose going over to let Dad off, and
you know it. I wanted you to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Reid returned, with surly
word.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve been leaving the sheep to go over there
and lie on your belly like a snake behind a bush to spy
on Joan and me, and I guess you&#8217;ve been doing it, all
right&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re welcome to all you&#8217;ve found out. There
aren&#8217;t any secrets between Joan and me to keep from
anybody&#8217;s eyes or ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid jerked his thin mouth in expression of derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s green, she&#8217;s as soft as cheese. Any man could
kiss her&ndash;&ndash;I could have done it fifteen minutes after I
saw her the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Reid hoped to provoke a quarrel leading up to an
excuse for making use of the gun for which his hand
seemed to itch, he fell short of his calculations. Mackenzie
only laughed, lightly, happily, in the way of a
man who knew the world was his.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a poor loser, Earl,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the loser yet&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m only takin&#8217; up my hand
to play. There won&#8217;t be room on this range for you
and me, Mackenzie, unless you step back in your schoolteacher&#8217;s
place, and lie down like a little lamb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty big range,&#8221; Mackenzie said, as if he
considered it seriously; &#8220;I guess you can shift whenever
the notion takes you. You might take a little vacation
of about three years back in a certain state concern in
Nebraska.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that drop&ndash;&ndash;keep your hands off of that! You
don&#8217;t know anything about that little matter; that
damned sheriff don&#8217;t know anything about it. If Sullivan&#8217;s
satisfied to have me here and give me his girl,
that&#8217;s enough for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want Joan,&#8221; said Mackenzie, speaking
slowly, &#8220;you only want what&#8217;s conditioned on taking
her. So you&#8217;d just as well make a revision in your plans
right now, Reid. You and Sullivan can get together on
it and do what you please, but Joan must be left out
of your calculations. I realize that I owe you a good
deal, but I&#8217;m not going to turn Joan over to you to
square the debt. You can have my money any day you
want it&ndash;&ndash;you can have my life if you ever have to draw
on me that far&ndash;&ndash;but you can&#8217;t have Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie walked away from Reid at the conclusion
of this speech, which was of unprecedented length for
him, and of such earnestness that Reid was not likely to
forget it soon, no matter for its length. The dogs left
Reid to follow him.</p>
<p>That Reid had been fraternizing with Swan Carlson,
Mackenzie felt certain, drinking the night out with him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
in his camp. Carlson had a notoriety for his addiction
to drink, along with his other unsavory traits. With
Reid going off in two different directions from him,
Mackenzie saw trouble ahead between them growing fast.
More than likely one of them would have to leave the
range to avoid a clash at no distant day, for Reid was
in an ugly mood. Loneliness, liquor, discontent, native
meanness, and a desire to add to the fame in the sheep
country that the killing of Matt Hall had brought him,
would whirl the weak fellow to his destruction at no
distant day.</p>
<p>Yet Reid had stood by him like a man in that fight
with Matt Hall, when he could have sought safety in
withdrawal and left him to his unhappy end. There
was something coming to him on that account which a
man could not repudiate or ignore. Whatever might
rise between them, Mackenzie would owe his life to
Reid. Given the opportunity, he stood ready and
anxious to square the debt by a like service, and between
men a thing like that could not be paid in any
other way.</p>
<p>Reid remained a while sitting on the hilltop where
Mackenzie had found him, face in his hands, as before.
After a time he stretched out and went to sleep, the
ardent sun of noonday frying the lees of Swan Carlson&#8217;s
whisky out of him. Toward three o&#8217;clock he roused, got
his horse, saddled it, and rode away.</p>
<p>Mackenzie believed he was going to hunt more whisky,
and went to the rise of a ridge to see what course he
took. But instead of striking for Carlson&#8217;s, Reid laid
a course for Sullivan&#8217;s ranch-house. Going to Tim with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
a complaint against him, Mackenzie judged, contempt
for his smallness rising in him. Let him go.</p>
<p>Tim Sullivan might give him half his sheep if he
liked him well enough, but he could not give him Joan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>HERTHA CARLSON</h3>
</div>
<p>Swan Carlson or his woman was running a band
of sheep very close to the border of Tim Sullivan&#8217;s
lease. All afternoon Mackenzie had heard the plaint of
lambs; they had lifted their wavering chorus all during
Joan&#8217;s lesson, giving her great concern that Carlson
designed attempting a trespass on her father&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>Joan had come shortly after Reid&#8217;s unexplained departure,
and had gone back to her flock again uninformed
of Reid&#8217;s criminal career. Mackenzie felt that
he did not need the record of his rival to hold Joan out
of his hands. The world had changed around for him
amazingly in the past few days. Where the sheeplands
had promised little for him but a hard apprenticeship
and doubtful rewards a little while ago, they now
showered him with unexpected blessings.</p>
<p>He ruminated pleasantly on this sudden coming round
the corner into the fields of romance as he went to the
top of the hill at sunset to see what Swan Carlson was
about. Over in the next valley there spread a handful
of sheep, which the shepherd was ranging back to camp.
Mackenzie could not make sure at that distance whether
the keeper was woman or man.</p>
<p>Reid had not returned when Mackenzie plodded into
camp at dusk. His absence was more welcome, in truth,
than his company; Mackenzie hoped he would sulk a
long time and stay away until he got his course in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
sheep country plainly before his eyes. If he stayed his
three years there it would be on account of sheep, and
whatever he might win in his father&#8217;s good graces by his
fidelity. Joan was not to figure thenceforward in any
of his schemes.</p>
<p>Three years on the sheep range with no prospect of
Joan! That was what Reid had ahead of him now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d take mine in the pen,&#8221; Mackenzie said,
leaning back to comfort with his pipe. Night came
down; the dogs lay at his feet, noses on forepaws. Below
him the sheep were still. So, for a long time, submerged
in dreams.</p>
<p>One of the dogs lifted its head, its bristles rising, a
low growl in its throat. The other rose cautiously,
walking away crouching, with high-lifted feet. Mackenzie
listened, catching no noise to account for their
alarm. A little while, and the sound of Hertha Carlson&#8217;s
singing rose from the hill behind him, her song
the same, the doleful quality of its air unmodified.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Na-a-fer a-lo-o-one, na-a-fer a-lone,<br />
He promise na-fer to leafe me,<br />
Na-fer to leafe me a-lone!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Strange how she runs on that,&#8221; Mackenzie muttered,
listening for her to repeat, as he had heard her
the night her singing guided him to her melancholy
door. A little nearer now the song sounded, the notes
broken as if the singer walked, stumbling at times, so
much sadness in it, so much longing, such unutterable
hopelessness as to wring the listener&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Swan was beating her again, neglecting her, subjecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
her to the cruelties of his savage mind; there was
no need for the woman to come nearer to tell him that.
Only grief for which there was no comfort, despair in
which there was no hope, could tune a human note to
that eloquent expression of pain. Perhaps she was
wandering in the night now for the solace of weariness,
pouring out the three lines of her song in what seemed
the bitterness of accusation for a promise unfulfilled.</p>
<p>The dogs came back to Mackenzie&#8217;s side, where they
sat with ears lifted, but with no expression of hostility
or alarm in their bearing now. They were only curious,
as their master was curious, waiting to see if the wandering
singer would come on into camp.</p>
<p>There was no glow of lantern to guide her, and no
moon, but she came straight for where Mackenzie sat.
A little way off she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; she hailed, as if uncertain of her welcome.</p>
<p>Mackenzie requested her to come on, lighting the lantern
which he had ready to hand. Mrs. Carlson hesitated,
drawing back a little when she saw his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was Earl,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl&#8217;s not here tonight. Sit down and rest yourself,
Mrs. Carlson. You don&#8217;t remember me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember. You are the man who cut my chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d forgotten me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not forget so soon. A long time I wanted
to kill you for the blow you gave Swan that night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as Swan was good to you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;of
course you would. How do you feel about it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only cry now because he did not die. He was
different a little while after he got well, but again he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
forgets. He beats me; he leaves me alone with the
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew he was beating you again,&#8221; Mackenzie nodded,
confirming his speculation of a little while before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Swan thinks only of sheep; he
is worse since he bought Hall&#8217;s flock. It is more than
I can endure!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson was worried and worn, fast losing all
she had gained in flesh and color during Swan&#8217;s period
of kindness when she had thrown herself into his wild
ways and ridden the range like a fighting woman at his
side. Much of her comeliness remained in her sad face
and great, luminous, appealing eyes, for it was the
comeliness of melancholy which sorrow and hard usage
refined. She would carry her grace with her, and the
pale shred of her youthful beauty, down to the last hard
day. But it was something that Swan was insensible
to; it could not soften his hand toward her, nor bend
his wild thoughts to gentleness. Now he had denied
her again the little share he had granted her in his wild
life, and must break the thing he had made, going his
morose way alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard he&#8217;d bought Hall&#8217;s sheep,&#8221; Mackenzie
said. &#8220;Is he going to run them on this range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he says I shall go there, where the wolves are
many and bold, even by daylight, to watch over them.
There I would be more alone than here. I cannot go,
I cannot go! Let him kill me, but I will not go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a right to hire a man to run them; he can
afford it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His money grows like thistles. Where Swan touches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
the earth with the seed of it, money springs. Money is
a disease that he spreads when he walks, like the scales
that fall from a leper. Money! I pray God night and
day that a plague will sweep away his flocks, that a
thief will find his hiding place, that a fire will burn the
bank that locks in his gold, and make him poor. Poor,
he would be kind. A man&#8217;s proud heart bends down
when he is poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God help you!&#8221; said Mackenzie, pitying her from
the well of his tender heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;God is deaf; he cannot hear!&#8221; she said, bitter, hopeless,
yet rebellious against the silence of heaven and
earth that she could not penetrate with her lamentations
and bring relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you shouldn&#8217;t let yourself believe any such
thing,&#8221; he chided, yet with a gentleness that was almost
an encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This land is a vacuum, out of which sound cannot
reach him, then,&#8221; she sighed, bending her sad head upon
her hands. &#8220;I have cried out to him in a sorrow that
would move a stone on the mountain-side, but God has
not heard. Yes, it must be that this land is a vacuum,
such as I read of when I was a girl in school. Maybe&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
looking up with eager hopefulness&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;if I go out of it
a little way, just on the edge of it and pray, God will
be able to hear my voice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, as well as anywhere,&#8221; he said, moved by her
strange fancy, by the hunger of her voice and face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is because there is a curse on me&ndash;&ndash;the curse
of Swan&#8217;s money, of his evil ways!&#8221; She sprang up,
stretching her long arms wildly. &#8220;I will pray no more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
no more!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I will curse God, I will curse
him as Job cursed him, and fling myself from the rocks
and die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was on his feet beside her, his hand on her
shoulder as if he would stay her mad intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he said, shocked by the boldness of her
declaration. &#8220;Your troubles are hard enough to bear&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
thicken them with talk like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him blankly, as if she did not comprehend,
as though her reason had spent itself in this rebellious
outbreak against the unseen forces of her sad
destiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your woman?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she was your woman, but if she is not,
Swan can have her. Swan can have her, then; I do not
care now any more. Swan wants her, he speaks of her
in the night. Maybe when he takes her he will set me
free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson sat again near the lantern, curling her
legs beneath her with the facility of a dog, due to long
usage of them in that manner, Mackenzie believed, when
chained to the wall in her lonely house among the trees.
Mackenzie stood a little while watching her as she sat,
chin in her hands, pensive and sad. Presently he sat
near her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Swan tonight?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drinking whisky beside the wagon with Hector Hall.
They will not fight. No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he echoed, abstractedly, making a mental picture
of Carlson and Hall beside the sheep-wagon, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
light of a lantern on their faces, cards in their fists, a
jug of whisky in the middle ground within reach from
either hand. It was such diversion as Swan Carlson
would enjoy, the night around him as black as the
shadows of his own dead soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl did not come to me this night,&#8221; she said, complaining
in sad note. &#8220;He promised he would come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been going over there to see you?&#8221; Mackenzie
asked, resentful of any advantage Reid might be
seeking over this half-mad creature.</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes love to me when Swan is away,&#8221; she
said, nodding slowly, looking up with serious eyes. &#8220;But
it is only false love; there is a lie in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right about that,&#8221; Mackenzie said, letting
go a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;He tries to flatter me to tell him where Swan hides
the money he brought from the bank,&#8221; she said, slowly,
wearily, &#8220;but him I do not trust. When I ask him to
do what must first be done to make me free, he will not
speak, but goes away, pale, pale, like a frightened girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better tell him to stay away,&#8221; Mackenzie
counseled, his voice stern and hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would not do that,&#8221; she continued, heedless
of his admonition. She leaned toward him, her
great eyes shining in the light, her face eager in its
sorrowful comeliness; she put out her hand and touched
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a brave man, you would not turn white and
go away into the night like a wolf to hear me speak
of that. Hush! hush! No, no&ndash;&ndash;there is no one to
hear.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>She looked round with fearful eyes, crouching closer
to the ground, her breath drawn in long labor, her
hand tightening on his arm. Mackenzie felt a shudder
sweep coldly over him, moved by the tragedy her attitude
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she whispered, hand to her mouth. And
again, leaning and peering: &#8220;Hush!&#8221; She raised her
face to him, a great eagerness in her burning eyes. &#8220;Kill
him, kill Swan Carlson, kind young man, and set me
free again! You have no woman? I will be your
woman. Kill him, and take me away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to kill Swan to get away from him,&#8221;
he told her, the tragedy dying out of the moment, leaving
only pity in its place. &#8220;You can go on tonight&ndash;&ndash;you
never need to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hertha came nearer, scrambling to him with sudden
movement on her knees, put her arm about his neck
before he could read her intention or repel her, and
whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where Swan hides the money&ndash;&ndash;I can lead
you to the place. Kill him, good man, and we will take
it and go far away from this unhappy land. I will be
your woman, faithful and true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he said gently, as if to humor
her; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t leave my sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep, sheep!&#8221; said she, bitterly. &#8220;It is all in the
world men think of in this land&ndash;&ndash;sheep! A woman is
nothing to them when there are sheep! Swan forgets,
sheep make him forget. If he had no sheep, he would
be a kind man to me again. Swan forgets, he forgets!&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent forward, looking at the lantern as if drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
by the blaze, her great eyes bright as a deer&#8217;s when it
stands fascinated by a torchlight a moment before
bounding away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan forgets, Swan forgets!&#8221; she murmured, her
staring eyes on the light. She rocked herself from side
to side, and &#8220;Swan forgets, Swan forgets!&#8221; she murmured,
like the burden of a lullaby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your camp?&#8221; Mackenzie asked her, thinking
he must take her home.</p>
<p>Hertha did not reply. For a long time she sat leaning,
staring at the lantern. One of the dogs approached
her, bristles raised in fear, creeping with stealthy movement,
feet lifted high, stretched its neck to sniff her,
fearfully, backed away, and composed itself to rest. But
now and again it lifted its head to sniff the scent that
came from this strange being, and which it could not
analyze for good or ill. Mackenzie marked its troubled
perplexity, almost as much at sea in his own reckoning
of her as the dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I could not show you the money and go away
with you leaving Swan living behind,&#8221; she said at last,
as if she had decided it finally in her mind. &#8220;That I
have told Earl Reid. Swan would follow me to the edge
of the world; he would strangle my neck between his
hands and throw me down dead at his feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have a right to if you did him that kind of a
trick,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl Reid comes with promises,&#8221; she said, unmindful
of Mackenzie; &#8220;he sits close by me in the dark, he holds
me by the hand. But kiss me I will not permit; that yet
belongs to Swan.&#8221; She looked up, sweeping Mackenzie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
with her appealing eyes. &#8220;But if you would kill him,
then my lips would be hot for your kiss, brave man&ndash;&ndash;I
would bend down and draw your soul into mine through
a long, long kiss!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; Mackenzie commanded, sternly. &#8220;Such
thoughts belong to Swan, as much as the other. Don&#8217;t
talk that way to me&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want to hear any more
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hertha sat looking at him, that cast of dull hopelessness
in her face again, the light dead in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are strange noises that I hear in the night,&#8221;
she said, woefully; &#8220;there is a dead child that never drew
breath pressed against my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go back to your wagon,&#8221; he suggested,
getting to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no wagon, only a canvas spread over the
brushes, where I lie like a wolf in a hollow. A beast I
am become, among the beasts of the field!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; he offered, holding out
his hand to lift her.</p>
<p>She did not seem to notice him, but sat stroking her
face as if to ease a pain out of it, or open the fount of
her tears which much weeping must have drained long,
long ago.</p>
<p>Mackenzie believed she was going insane, in the slow-preying,
brooding way of those who are not strong
enough to withstand the cruelties of silence and loneliness
on the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your woman?&#8221; she asked again, lifting her
face suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no woman,&#8221; he told her, gently, in great pity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
for her cruel burden under which she was so unmistakably
breaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember, you told me you had no woman. A man
should have a woman; he goes crazy of the lonesomeness
on the sheep range without a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Swan be over tomorrow?&#8221; Mackenzie asked,
thinking to take her case up with the harsh and savage
man and see if he could not be moved to sending her
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she returned coldly, her manner
changing like a capricious wind. She rose as she spoke,
and walked away, disappearing almost at once in the
darkness.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stood looking the way she went, listening
for the sound of her going, but she passed so surely
among the shrubs and over the uneven ground that no
noise attended her. It was as though her failing mind
had sharpened her with animal caution, or that instinct
had come forward in her to take the place of wit, and
serve as her protection against dangers which her faculties
might no longer safeguard.</p>
<p>Even the dogs seemed to know of her affliction, as
wild beasts are believed by some to know and accept
on a common plane the demented among men. They
knew at once that she was not going to harm the sheep.
When she left camp they stretched themselves with contented
sighs to their repose.</p>
<p>And that was &#8220;the lonesomeness&#8221; as they spoke of it
there. A dreadful affliction, a corrosive poison that
gnawed the heart hollow, for which there was no cure
but comradeship or flight. Poor Hertha Carlson was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
denied both remedies; she would break in a little while
now, and run mad over the hills, her beautiful hair
streaming in the wind.</p>
<p>And Reid had it; already it had struck deep into his
soul, turning him morose, wickedly vindictive, making
him hungry with an unholy ambition to slay. Joan
must have suffered from the same disorder. It was not
so much a desire in her to see what lay beyond the blue
curtain of the hills as a longing for companionship
among them.</p>
<p>But Joan would put away her unrest; she had found
a cure for the lonesomeness. Her last word to him that
day was that she did not want to leave the sheep range
now; that she would stay while he remained, and fare
as he fared.</p>
<p>Rachel must have suffered from the lonesomeness,
ranging her sheep over the Mesopotamian plain; Jacob
had it when he felt his heart dissolve in tears at the
sight of his kinswoman beside the well of Haran. But
Joan was safe from it now; its insidious poison would
corrode in her heart no more.</p>
<p>Poor Hertha Carlson, deserving better than fate had
given her with sheep-mad Swan! She could not reason
without violence any longer, so often she had been subjected
to its pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a thousand wonders if she doesn&#8217;t kill him
herself,&#8221; Mackenzie said, sitting down with new
thoughts.</p>
<p>The news of Swan&#8217;s buying Hall out was important
and unexpected. Free to leave the country now, Hall
very likely would be coming over to balance accounts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
There was his old score against Mackenzie for his humiliation
at the hands of the apprentice sheepherder,
which doubtless had grown more bitter day by day; and
there was his double account against Reid and Mackenzie
for the loss of his sheep-killing brother. Mackenzie
hoped that he would go away and let matters stand as
they were.</p>
<p>And Swan. It had not been all a jest, then, when he
proposed trading his woman for Mackenzie&#8217;s. What a
wild, irresponsible, sheep-mad man he was! But he
hardly would attempt any violence toward Joan, even
though he &#8220;spoke of her in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Carlson, Mackenzie&#8217;s thoughts ran out after
Reid. Contempt rose in him, and deepened as he
thought of the mink-faced youth carrying his deceptive
poison into the wild Norseman&#8217;s camp. But insane as
she was, racked by the lonesomeness to be away from
that unkindly land, Hertha Carlson remained woman
enough to set a barrier up that Reid, sneak that he was,
could not cross.</p>
<p>What a condition she had made, indeed! Nothing
would beguile her from it; only its fulfilment would bend
her to yield to his importunities. It was a shocking
mess that Reid had set for himself to drink some day,
for Swan Carlson would come upon them in their hand-holding
in his hour, as certainly as doom.</p>
<p>And there was the picture of the red-haired giant of
the sheeplands and that flat-chested, sharp-faced youth
drinking beside the sheep-wagon in the night. There
was Swan, lofty, cold, unbending; there was Reid, the
craft, the knowledge of the world&#8217;s under places written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
on his brow, the deceit that he practiced against his
host hidden away in his breast.</p>
<p>Mackenzie sighed, putting it from him like a nightmare
that calls a man from his sleep by its false peril,
wringing sweat from him in its agony. Let them bind
in drink and sever in blood, for all that he cared. It
was nothing to him, any way they might combine or
clash. Joan was his; that was enough to fill his world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>SWAN CARLSON&#8217;S DAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Dad Frazer came over the hills next morning
after the dew was gone. Mackenzie saw him
from afar, and was interested to note that he was not
alone. That is to say, not immediately accompanied
by anybody, yet not alone for a country where a quarter
of a mile between men is rather close company.</p>
<p>Somebody was coming on after the old shepherd,
holding about the same distance behind him in spite of
little dashes down slopes that Dad made when for a
moment out of sight. Mackenzie&#8217;s wonder over this
peculiar behavior grew as the old man came near, and
it was discovered to the eye that his persistent shadow
was a woman.</p>
<p>Dad wasted neither words nor breath on his explanation
when he came panting up the slope that brought
him to the place where Mackenzie stood above his sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that dad-burned Rabbit!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There was something between vexation and respect
in Dad&#8217;s voice. He turned to look back as he spoke.
Rabbit had mounted the hilltop just across the dip,
where she stood looking over at her shifty-footed lord,
two sheep-dogs at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did she locate you?&#8221; Mackenzie inquired, not
in the least displeased over this outreaching of justice
after the fickle old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been trailin&#8217; me four years!&#8221; Dad whispered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
his respect for Rabbit&#8217;s powers on the scent unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a long time to hold a cold trail. Rabbit must
be some on the track!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t beat them Indians follerin&#8217; a man if they
set their heads to it. Well, it&#8217;s all off with the widow-lady
at Four Corners now&ndash;&ndash;Rabbit&#8217;s got me nailed.
You see them sheep-dogs? Them dogs they&#8217;d jump me
the minute Rabbit winked at &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;d chaw me up
like a couple of lions. She&#8217;s raised &#8217;em up to do it,
dad-burn her! Had my old vest to learn &#8217;em the scent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man never ought to leave his old vest behind him
when he runs away from his wife,&#8221; said Mackenzie,
soberly. &#8220;But it looks to me like a woman with the
sticking qualities Rabbit&#8217;s got isn&#8217;t a bad one to stay
married to. How in the world could a reservation squaw
find her way around to follow you all this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s educated, dang her; she went to the sisters&#8217;
mission. She can read and write a sight better than
me. She&#8217;s too smart for a squaw, bust her greasy eyes!
Yes, and I&#8217;ll never dast to lay a hand on her with them
dogs around. They&#8217;d chaw me up quicker&#8217;n a man
could hang up his hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rabbit composed herself after her patient but persistent
way, sitting among the bushes with only her
head showing, waiting for Dad&#8217;s next move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re married to her regularly, are you, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Priest marriage, dang it all!&#8221; said Dad, hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it <i>is</i> all off with the one-eyed widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and them four thousand sheep, and that range
all under fence, dang my melts!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about Rabbit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t what am I goin&#8217; to do about her, John, but
what she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do about me. She&#8217;ll never leave me
out of her sight a minute as long as I live. I reckon
I&#8217;ll have to stay right here and run sheep for Tim, and
that widow-lady wonderin&#8217; why I don&#8217;t show up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might do worse, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon I might. Rabbit she&#8217;s as good as any
man on the range handlin&#8217; sheep, she can draw a man&#8217;s
pay wherever she goes. I guess I could put her to work,
and that&#8217;d help some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad brightened a bit at that prospect, and drew his
breath with a new hope. Even with the widow gone
from his calculations, the future didn&#8217;t promise all loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I bet you I&#8217;ll shoot them two dogs the first time
I can draw a bead on &#8217;em!&#8221; Dad declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if you&#8217;ll treat Rabbit the right way she&#8217;ll
sell them. Call her over, Dad; I&#8217;d like to get acquainted
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad beckoned with his hand, but Rabbit did not stir;
waved his hat to emphasize his command; Rabbit remained
quiet among the bushes, the top of her black
head in plain view.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s afraid we&#8217;ve hatched up some kind of a trick
between us to work off on her,&#8221; said Dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t blame her for being a little distrustful,
Dad. But let her go; I&#8217;ll meet her at your camp one
of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll meet her over there, all right, for she&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to stick to me till I&#8217;m under ground. That&#8217;s one
time too many I married&ndash;&ndash;just one time too many!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose a man can overdo it; I&#8217;ve heard it said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; left that blame vest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that seems to be where you blundered. You&#8217;ll
know better next time, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but there never will be no next time,&#8221; Dad
sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Reid over your way this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t seen him. Is he still roamin&#8217; and restless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left yesterday; I thought he was going to the
ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t pass my way. That feller&#8217;s off, I tell you,
John; he&#8217;s one of the kind that can&#8217;t stand the lonesomeness.
Leave him out here alone two months, and
he&#8217;d put a bullet in his eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me like it&#8217;s a land of daftness,&#8221; Mackenzie
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find a good many cracked people all over the
sheep country&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m kind o&#8217; cracked myself. I must be,
or I never would &#8217;a&#8217; left that vest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad took off his hat to smooth his sweeping curled
locks, as white as shredded asbestos, and full of the
same little gleams that mineral shows when a block of
it from the mine is held in the sun. His beard was
whitening over his face again, like a frost that defied
the heat of day, easing its hollows and protuberances,
easing some of the weakness that the barber&#8217;s razor had
laid so pitilessly bare. In a few days more he would
appear himself again, and be ready for the sheep-shears
in due time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll have to make the best of the place I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
in, but for a man of puncture, as the feller said, like I
used to think I was, I sure did miscombobble it when I
married that educated squaw. No woman I ever was
married to in my life ever had sense enough to track a
man like that woman&#8217;s follered me. She sure is a wonder
on the scent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patiently Rabbit was sitting among the bushes, waiting
the turn of events, not to be fooled again, not to
be abandoned, if vigilance could insure her against such
distress. Mackenzie&#8217;s admiration for the woman grew
with Dad&#8217;s discomfiture over his plight. There was an
added flavor of satisfaction for him in the old man&#8217;s
blighted career. Wise Rabbit, to have a priest marriage,
and wiser still to follow this old dodger of the
sheeplands and bring him up with a short halter in the
evening of his days.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go on back and look after them sheep,&#8221; said
Dad, with a certain sad inflection of resignation;
&#8220;there&#8217;s nothing else to <i>be</i> done. I was aimin&#8217; to serve
notice on Tim to find another man in my place, but I
might as well keep on. Well, I can set in the shade,
anyhow, and let Rabbit do the work&ndash;&ndash;her and them
blame dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad sighed. It helped a great deal to know that
Rabbit could do the work. He looked long toward the
spot where his unshaken wife kept her watch on him,
but seemed to be looking over her head, perhaps trying
to measure all he had lost by this coming between him
and the one-eyed widow-lady of Four Corners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I could git you to write a letter over to
that widow and tell her I&#8217;m dead?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it if you want me to. But you&#8217;re not dead
yet, Dad&ndash;&ndash;you may outlive Rabbit and marry the widow
at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was no lucky man,&#8221; said Dad, smoothing his
gleaming hair. &#8220;A man that&#8217;s married and nailed down
to one place is the same as dead; he might as well be in
his grave. If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; got that widow-lady I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had the
means and the money to go ridin&#8217; around and seein&#8217; the
sights from the end of one of them cars with a brass
fence around it. But I&#8217;m nailed down now, John; I&#8217;m
cinched.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad was so melancholy over his situation that he
went off without more words, a thing unheard of for
him. He gave Rabbit a wide fairway as he passed.
When he was a respectable distance ahead the squaw
rose from her bush and followed, such determination in
her silent movements as to make Dad&#8217;s hope for future
freedom hollow indeed. The old man was cinched at
last; Mackenzie was glad that it was so.</p>
<p>The sound of Carlson&#8217;s sheep was still near that
morning, and coming nearer, as whoever attended them
ranged them slowly along. Mackenzie went a little way
across the hill in that direction, but could not see the
shepherd, although the sheep were spread on the slope
just before him. It was a small flock, numbering not
above seven hundred. Mackenzie was puzzled why
Swan wanted to employ his own or his wife&#8217;s time in
grazing so small a number, when four times as many
could be handled as easily.</p>
<p>This question was to be answered for him very soon,
and in a way which he never had imagined. Yet there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
was no foreboding of it in the calm noonday as he prepared
his dinner in the shade of some welcome willows,
the heat glimmering over the peaceful hills.</p>
<p>It was while Mackenzie sat dozing in the fringe of
shade such as a hedge would cast at noonday that the
snarl of fighting dogs brought him up to a realization
of what was going forward among the sheep. His own
flock had drifted like a slow cloud to the point of the
long ridge, and there Swan Carlson&#8217;s band had joined
it. The two flocks were mingling now, and on the edge
of the confused mass his own dogs and Carlson&#8217;s were
fighting.</p>
<p>Swan was not in sight; nobody seemed to be looking
after the sheep; it appeared as if they had been
left to drift as they might to this conjunction with
Mackenzie&#8217;s flock. Mackenzie believed Mrs. Carlson
had abandoned her charge and fled Swan&#8217;s cruelty,
but he did not excuse himself for his own stupidity in
allowing the flocks to come together as he ran to the
place where his dogs and Carlson&#8217;s fought.</p>
<p>The sheep were becoming more hopelessly mingled
through this commotion on their flank. Mackenzie was
beating the enraged dogs apart when Swan Carlson
came running around the point of the hill.</p>
<p>Swan immediately took part in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of gnashing,
rolling, rearing dogs, laying about among them with
impartial hand, quickly subduing them to obedience. He
stood looking stonily at Mackenzie, unmoved by anger,
unflushed by exertion. In that way he stood silent a
little while, his face untroubled by any passion that
rolled in his breast.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re runnin&#8217; your sheep over on my grass&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;
said Swan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mile over my range,&#8221; Mackenzie accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been crowdin&#8217; over on me for a month,&#8221;
Swan said, &#8220;and I didn&#8217;t say nothing. But when a man
tries to run his sheep over amongst mine and drive &#8217;em
off, I take a hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody&#8217;s tryin&#8217; such a game as that, it&#8217;s you,&#8221;
Mackenzie told him. &#8220;Get &#8217;em out of here, and keep
&#8217;em out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got fifteen hundred in that band&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll have to
help me cut &#8217;em out,&#8221; said Swan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had about seven hundred,&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
dispassionately, although it broke on him suddenly what
the big flockmaster was trying to put through.</p>
<p>Counting on Mackenzie&#8217;s greenness, and perhaps on
the simplicity of his nature as they had read it in the
sheep country, Swan had prepared this trap days ahead.
He had run a small band of the same breed as Sullivan&#8217;s
sheep&ndash;&ndash;for that matter but one breed was extensively
grown on the range&ndash;&ndash;over to the border of Tim&#8217;s lease
with the intention of mingling them and driving home
more than he had brought. Mackenzie never had heard
of the trick being worked on a green herder, but he
realized now how simply it could be done, opportunity
such as this presenting.</p>
<p>But it was one thing to bring the sheep over and
another thing to take them away. One thing Mackenzie
was sure of, and that was the judgment of his eyes
in numbering sheep. That had been Dad Frazer&#8217;s first
lesson, and the old man had kept him at it until he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
could come within a few head among hundreds at a
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you cut out as many as you had,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, running his eyes over the mingled flocks,
&#8220;they&#8217;re all alike, one as good as another, I guess. It
looks like you got your stock from this ranch, anyhow,
but you&#8217;ll not take more than seven hundred this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dogs can cut mine out, they know &#8217;em by the
smell,&#8221; Swan said. &#8220;I had fifteen hundred, and I bet
you I&#8217;ll take fifteen hundred back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dogs had drawn off, each set behind their respective
masters, panting, eyeing each other with hostility,
one rising now and then with growls, threatening to
open the battle again. The sheep drifted about in confusion,
so thoroughly mingled now that it would be past
human power to separate them again and apportion
each respective head to its rightful owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven hundred, at the outside,&#8221; Mackenzie said
again. &#8220;And keep them off of my grass when you get
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlson stood where he had stopped, ten feet or more
distant, his arms bare, shirt open on his breast in his
way of picturesque freedom. Mackenzie waited for him
to proceed in whatever way he had planned, knowing
there could be no compromise, no settlement in peace.
He would either have to yield entirely and allow Carlson
to drive off seven or eight hundred of Sullivan&#8217;s
sheep, or fight. There didn&#8217;t seem to be much question
on how it would come out in the latter event, for Carlson
was not armed, and Mackenzie&#8217;s pistol was that
moment under his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You got a gun on you,&#8221; said Swan, in casual, disinterested
tone. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no gun on me, but I&#8217;m a
better man without no gun than you are with one. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to take my fifteen hundred sheep home with me,
and you ain&#8217;t man enough to stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlson&#8217;s two dogs were sitting close behind him, one
of them a gaunt gray beast that seemed almost a purebred
wolf. Its jaws were bloody from its late encounter;
flecks of blood were on its gray coat. It sat panting
and alert, indifferent to Mackenzie&#8217;s presence, watching
the sheep as if following its own with its savage eyes.
Suddenly Carlson spoke an explosive word, clapping his
great hands, stamping his foot toward Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Mackenzie fired as the wolf-dog sprang, staggering
back from the weight of its lank body hurled against his
breast, and fired again as he felt the beast&#8217;s vile breath
in his face as it snapped close to his throat.</p>
<p>Mackenzie emptied his pistol in quick, but what
seemed ineffectual, shots at the other dog as it came
leaping at Carlson&#8217;s command. In an instant he was
involved in a confusion of man and dog, the body of the
wolfish collie impeding his feet as he fought.</p>
<p>Carlson and the other dog pressed the attack so
quickly that Mackenzie had no time to slip even another
cartridge into his weapon. Carlson laughed as he
clasped him in his great arms, the dog clinging to Mackenzie&#8217;s
pistol hand, and in a desperate moment it was
done. Mackenzie was lying on his back, the giant sheepman&#8217;s
knee in his chest.</p>
<p>Carlson did not speak after ordering the dog away.
He held Mackenzie a little while, hand on his throat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
knee on his chest, looking with unmoved features down
into his eyes, as if he considered whether to make an
end of him there or let him go his way in added humiliation
and disgrace. Mackenzie lay still under Carlson&#8217;s
hand, trying to read his intention in his clear, ice-cold,
expressionless eyes, watching for his moment to renew
the fight which he must push under such hopeless disadvantage.</p>
<p>Swan&#8217;s eyes betrayed nothing of his thoughts. They
were as calm and untroubled as the sky, which Mackenzie
thought, with a poignant sweep of transcendant fear
for his life, he never had beheld so placid and beautiful
as in that dreadful moment.</p>
<p>Carlson&#8217;s huge fingers began to tighten in the grip
of death; relax, tighten, each successive clutch growing
longer, harder. The joy of his strength, the pleasure
in the agony that spoke from his victim&#8217;s face, gleamed
for a moment in Carlson&#8217;s eyes as he bent, gazing; then
flickered like a light in the wind, and died.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s revolver lay not more than four feet
from his hand. He gathered his strength for a struggle
to writhe from under Carlson&#8217;s pressing knee. Carlson,
anticipating his intention, reached for the weapon and
snatched it, laying hold of it by the barrel.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s unexpected renewal of the fight surprised
Carlson into releasing his strangling hold. He rose to
sitting posture, breast to breast with the fighting sheepman,
whose great bulk towered above him, free breath
in his nostrils, fresh hope in his heart. He fought desperately
to come to his feet, Carlson sprawling over
him, the pistol lifted high for a blow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s hands were clutching Carlson&#8217;s throat,
he was on one knee, swaying the Norseman&#8217;s body back
in the strength of despair, when the heavens seemed
to crash above him, the fragments of universal destruction
burying him under their weight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>NOT CUT OUT FOR A SHEEPMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie returned to conscious state in nausea
and pain. Not on a surge, but slow-breaking,
like the dawn, his senses came to him, assembling
as dispersed birds assemble, with erratic excursions as
if distrustful of the place where they desire to alight.
Wherever the soul may go in such times of suspended
animation, it comes back to its dwelling in trepidation
and distrust, and with lingering at the door.</p>
<p>The first connected thought that Mackenzie enjoyed
after coming out of his shock was that somebody was
smoking near at hand; the next that the sun was in his
eyes. But these were indifferent things, drowned in
a flood of pain. He put them aside, not to grope after
the cause of his discomfort, for that was apart from
him entirely, but to lie, throbbing in every nerve, indifferent
either to life or death.</p>
<p>Presently his timid life came back entirely, settling
down in the old abode with a sigh. Then Mackenzie
remembered the poised revolver in Swan Carlson&#8217;s hand.
He moved, struggling to rise, felt a sweep of sickness,
a flood of pain, but came to a sitting posture in the way
of a man fighting to life from beneath an avalanche.
The sun was directly in his eyes, standing low above the
hill. He shifted weakly to relieve its discomfort. Earl
Reid was sitting near at hand, a few feet above him on
the side of the hill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>Reid was smoking a cigarette, his hat pushed back,
the shadows of his late discontent cleared out of his
face. Below them the sheep were grazing. They were
all there; Mackenzie had wit enough in him to see that
they were all there.</p>
<p>Reid looked at him with a grin that seemed divided
between amusement and scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re cut out for a sheepman, Mackenzie,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It begins to look like it,&#8221; Mackenzie admitted. He
was too sick to inquire into the matter of Reid&#8217;s recovery
of the sheep; the world tipped at the horizon, as
it tips when one is sick at sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hand&#8217;s chewed up some, Mackenzie,&#8221; Reid told
him. &#8220;I think you&#8217;d better go to the ranch and have
it looked after; you can take my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was almost indifferent both to the information
of his hurt and the offer for its relief. He lifted
his right hand to look at it, and in glancing down saw
his revolver in the holster at his side. This was of more
importance to him for the moment than his injury.
Swan Carlson was swinging that revolver to strike him
when he saw it last. How did it get back there in his
holster? Where was Carlson; what had happened to
him? Mackenzie looked at Reid as for an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He batted you over the head with your gun&ndash;&ndash;I guess
he used your gun, I found it out there by you,&#8221; said
Reid, still grinning as if he could see the point of humor
in it that Mackenzie could not be expected to enjoy.</p>
<p>Mackenzie did not attempt a reply. He looked with
a sort of impersonal curiosity at his hand and forearm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
where the dog had bitten him in several places. That
had happened a good while ago, he reasoned; the blood
had dried, the marks of the dog&#8217;s teeth were bruised-looking
around the edges.</p>
<p>And the sheep were all there, and Reid was laughing
at him in satisfaction of his disgrace. There was no
sound of Swan Carlson&#8217;s flock, no sight of the sheepman.
Reid had come and untangled what Mackenzie
had failed to prevent, and was sitting there, unruffled
and undisturbed, enjoying already the satisfaction of
his added distinction.</p>
<p>Perhaps Reid had saved his life from Carlson&#8217;s hands,
as he had saved it from Matt Hall&#8217;s. His debt to Reid
was mounting with mocking swiftness. As if in scorn of
his unfitness, Reid had picked up his gun and put it
back in its sheath.</p>
<p>What would Joan say about this affair? What would
Tim Sullivan&#8217;s verdict be? He had not come off even
second best, as in the encounter with Matt Hall, but defeated,
disgraced. And he would have been robbed in
open day, like a baby, if it hadn&#8217;t been for Reid&#8217;s interference.
Mackenzie began to think with Dad Frazer
that he was not a lucky man.</p>
<p>Too simple and too easy, too trusting and too slow,
as they thought of him in the sheep country. A sort of
kindly indictment it was, but more humiliating because
it seemed true. No, he was not cut out for a sheepman,
indeed, nor for anything but that calm and placid
woman&#8217;s work in the schoolroom, it seemed.</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked again at his hand. There was no
pain in it, but its appearance was sufficient to alarm a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
man in a normal state of reasonableness. He had the
passing thought that it ought to be attended to, and got
up on weaving legs. He might wash it in the creek, he
considered, and so take out the rough of whatever infection
the dog&#8217;s teeth had driven into his flesh, but dismissed
the notion at once as altogether foolish. It
needed bichloride of mercury, and it was unlikely there
was such a thing within a hundred and fifty miles.</p>
<p>As he argued this matter of antiseptics with himself
Mackenzie walked away from the spot where Reid remained
seated, going aimlessly, quite unconscious of his
act. Only when he found himself some distance away he
stopped, considering what to do. His thoughts ran in
fragments and flashes, broken by the throbbing of his
shocked brain, yet he knew that Reid had offered to do
something for him which he could not accept.</p>
<p>No, he could not place himself under additional obligation
to Reid. Live or die, fail or succeed, Reid
should not be called upon again to offer a supporting
hand. He could sit there on the hillside and grin about
this encounter with Carlson, and grin about the hurt in
Mackenzie&#8217;s hand and arm, and the blinding pain in his
head. Let him grin in his high satisfaction of having
turned another favor to Mackenzie&#8217;s account; let him
grin until his face froze in a grin&ndash;&ndash;he should not have
Joan.</p>
<p>Mackenzie went stumbling on again to the tune of
that declaration. Reid should not have Joan, he
shouldn&#8217;t have Joan, shouldn&#8217;t have Joan! Blind from
pain, sick, dizzy, the earth rising up before him as he
walked, Mackenzie went on. He did not look back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
see if Reid came to help him; he would have resented it
if he had come, and cursed him and driven him away.
For he should not have Joan; not have Joan; Joan,
Joan, Joan!</p>
<p>How he found his way to Dad Frazer&#8217;s camp Mackenzie
never could tell. It was long past dark when he
stumbled to the sheep-wagon wherein the old herder and
his squaw lay asleep, arriving without alarm of dogs,
his own collies at his heels. It was the sharp-eared Indian
woman who heard him, and knew by his faltering
step that it was somebody in distress. She ran out and
caught him as he fell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A MILLION GALLOPS OFF</h3>
</div>
<p>Joan was returning to camp, weighed down by a
somber cloud. Dad Frazer had carried word to her
early that morning of Mackenzie&#8217;s condition, the old
man divided in his opinion as to whether man or beast
had mauled the shepherd and left him in such melancholy
plight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both man and beast,&#8221; Rabbit had told Joan, having
no division of mind in the case at all. And so Joan believed
it to be, also, after sitting for hours in the hot
sheep-wagon beside the mangled, unconscious schoolmaster,
who did not move in pain, nor murmur in delirium,
nor drop one word from his clenched, still lips to
tell whose hand had inflicted this terrible punishment.</p>
<p>And the range seemed bent on making a secret of it,
also. Dad had gone hot-foot on Joan&#8217;s horse to seek
Earl Reid and learn the truth of it, only to ride in vain
over the range where Mackenzie&#8217;s flock grazed. Reid
was not in camp; the sheep were running unshepherded
upon the hills. Now, Joan, heading back to her camp at
dusk of the longest, heaviest, darkest day she ever had
known, met Reid as she rode away from Dad Frazer&#8217;s
wagon, and started out of her brooding to hasten forward
and question him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen&ndash;&ndash;who did it?&#8221; she inquired, riding
up breathlessly where Reid lounged on his horse at
the top of the hill waiting for her to come to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Happen? What happen?&#8221; said Reid, affecting surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mackenzie&ndash;&ndash;surely you must know something
about it&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s nearly killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mackenzie.&#8221; Reid spoke indifferently, tossing
away his cigarette, laughing a little as he shaped the
shepherd&#8217;s name. &#8220;Mackenzie had a little trouble with
Swan Carlson, but this time he didn&#8217;t land his lucky
blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you knew all about it,&#8221; Joan said, sweeping
him a scornful, accusing look. &#8220;I had you sized up
about that way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I know all about it, Joan,&#8221; Reid said, but with
a gentle sadness in his soft voice that seemed to express
his pity for the unlucky man. &#8220;I happened to be away
when it started, but I got there&ndash;&ndash;well, I got there, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan&#8217;s eyes were still severe, but a question grew in
them as she faced him, looking at him searchingly, as if
to read what it was he hid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been all day? Dad&#8217;s been looking
high and low for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I was over at Carlson&#8217;s when the old snoozer
came,&#8221; Reid told her, easy and careless, confident and
open, in his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlson&#8217;s? What business could you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he tell you about it, Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackenzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t spoken since he stumbled into Dad&#8217;s camp
last night. He&#8217;s going to die!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not that bad, Joan?&#8221; Reid jerked his horse
about with quick hand as he spoke, making as if to start
down at once to the camp where the wounded schoolmaster
lay. &#8220;Why, he walked off yesterday afternoon
like he wasn&#8217;t hurt much. Unconscious?&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan nodded, a feeling in her throat as if she choked
on cold tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think he got much of a jolt when Swan took
his gun away from him and soaked him over the head
with it,&#8221; said Reid, regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were there, and you let him do it!&#8221; Joan felt
that she disparaged Mackenzie with the accusation as
soon as the hasty words fell from her tongue, but biting
the lips would not bring them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He needs <i>somebody</i> around with him, but I can&#8217;t be
right beside him all the time, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I guess he&#8217;s able to
take care of himself if they give him a show. If you
saw it, you can tell me how it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride along with you,&#8221; Reid offered; &#8220;I can&#8217;t do
him any good by going down to see him. Anybody gone
for a doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rabbit&#8217;s the only doctor. I suppose she can do him
as much good as anybody&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll die, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not cut out for a sheepman,&#8221; said Reid, ruminatively,
shaking his head in depreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should <i>hope</i> not!&#8221; said Joan, expressing in the
emphasis, as well as in the look of superior scorn that
she gave him, the difference that she felt lay between
Mackenzie and a clod who might qualify for a sheepman
and no questions asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride on over to camp with you,&#8221; Reid proposed
again, facing his horse to accompany her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t leave the sheep alone at night&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
bad enough to do it in the day. What was the
trouble between him and Swan&ndash;&ndash;who started it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of Swan&#8217;s sheep got over with ours&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t
know how it happened, or whose fault it was. I&#8217;d been
skirmishin&#8217; around a little, gettin&#8217; the lay of the country
mapped out in my mind. Swan and Mackenzie were
mixin&#8217; it up when I got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlson set his dogs on him!&#8221; Joan&#8217;s voice trembled
with her high scorn of such unmanly dealing, such unworthy
help.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have; one of the dogs was shot, and I
noticed Mackenzie&#8217;s hand was chewed up a little. They
were scuffling to get hold of Mackenzie&#8217;s gun when I got
there&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d dropped it, why, you can search me! Swan
got it. He hit him once with it before I could&ndash;&ndash;oh well,
I guess it don&#8217;t make any difference, Mackenzie wouldn&#8217;t
thank me for it. He&#8217;s a surly devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan touched his arm, as if to call him from his abstraction,
leaning to reach him, her face eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stopped Swan, you took the gun away from
him, didn&#8217;t you, Earl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s welcome to it&ndash;&ndash;I owed him something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan drew a deep breath, which seemed to reach her
stifling soul and revive it; a softness came into her face,
a light of appreciative thankfulness into her eyes. She
reined closer to Reid, eager now to hear the rest of the
melancholy story.</p>
<p>&#8220;You took the gun away from Swan; I saw it in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
scabbard down there. Did you have to&ndash;&ndash;did you have
to&ndash;&ndash;do anything to Carlson, Earl?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid laughed, shortly, harshly, a sound so old to
come from young lips. He did not meet Joan&#8217;s eager
eyes, but sat straight, head up, looking off over the
darkening hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t do anything to him&ndash;&ndash;more than jam
my gun in his neck. He got away with thirty sheep
more than belonged to him, though&ndash;&ndash;I found it out
when I counted ours. I guess I was over there after
them when Dad was lookin&#8217; for me today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought them back?&#8221; Joan leaned again, her
hand on his arm, where it remained a little spell, as she
looked her admiration into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to it,&#8221; said Reid, modestly, laughing again
in his grating harsh way of vast experience, and scorn
for the things which move the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal, I think,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But,&#8221; thoughtfully,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what made him drop his gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can search me,&#8221; said Reid, in his careless, unsympathetic
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have happened to anybody, though, a dog
and a man against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, even a better man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A better man don&#8217;t live,&#8221; said Joan, with calm decision.</p>
<p>Reid bent his eyes to the pommel of his saddle, and
sat so a few moments, in the way of a man who turns
something in his thoughts. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go on back to the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may never get well to thank you for what you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
did, Earl,&#8221; and Joan&#8217;s voice threatened tears in its low,
earnest tremolo, &#8220;but I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right, Joan.&#8221; Reid waved gratitude,
especially vicarious gratitude, aside, smiling lightly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not booked to go yet; wait till he&#8217;s well and let
him do his own talking. Somebody ought to sneak that
gun away from him, though, and slip a twenty-two in
his scabbard. They can&#8217;t hurt him so bad with that
when they take it away from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have happened to you!&#8221; she reproached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it might,&#8221; Reid allowed, after some reflection.
&#8220;Sure, it might,&#8221; brightening, looking at her frankly,
his ingenuous smile softening the crafty lines of his thin
face. &#8220;Well, leave him to Rabbit and Dad; they&#8217;ll fix
him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he isn&#8217;t better tomorrow I&#8217;m going for a doctor,
if nobody else will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not goin&#8217; to hang around there all the time,
are you, Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid&#8217;s face flushed as he spoke, his eyes made small, as
if he looked in at a furnace door.</p>
<p>Joan did not answer this, only lifted her face with a
quick start, looking at him with brows lifted, widening
her great, luminous, tender eyes. Reid stroked her
horse&#8217;s mane, his stirrup close to her foot, his look
downcast, as if ashamed of the jealousy he had betrayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the lessons, and that kind of stuff,&#8221;
said he, looking up suddenly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want the girl&ndash;&ndash;oh
well, you know as well as I do what kind of a deal
the old folks have fixed up for you and me, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;m going to marry you to save you
from work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was a raw deal when they sprung it on
me, but that was before I saw you, Joan. But it&#8217;s all
right; I&#8217;m for it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re easy, Earl; dad&#8217;s workin&#8217; you for three good
years without pay. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, you&#8217;d just
as well hit the breeze out of this country right now.
Dad can&#8217;t deliver the goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m soft, but I&#8217;m not that soft, Joan. I could leave
here tomorrow; what&#8217;s to hold me? And as far as the
old man&#8217;s cutting me out of his will goes, I could beat it
in law, and then have a pile big enough left to break my
neck if I was to jump off the top of it. They&#8217;re not
putting anything over on me, Joan. I&#8217;m sticking to this
little old range because it suits me to stick. I would
go tomorrow if it wasn&#8217;t for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid added this in a low voice, his words a sigh, doing
it well, even convincingly well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Joan said, moved by his apparent sincerity,
&#8220;but there&#8217;s not a bit of use in your throwing
away three years, or even three more months, of your
life here, Earl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll like me better when you begin to know me,
Joan. I&#8217;ve stood off because I didn&#8217;t want to interfere
with your studies, but maybe now, since you&#8217;ve got a
vacation, I can come over once in a while and get acquainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl, it wouldn&#8217;t be a bit of use.&#8221; Joan spoke earnestly,
pitying him a little, now that she began to believe
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re already engaged,&#8221; he said; &#8220;they&#8217;ve disposed
of us like they do princes and princesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how they marry them off, but if that&#8217;s
the way, it won&#8217;t work on the sheep range,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been engaged, officially, ever since I struck
the range, and I&#8217;ve never once, never even&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He hesitated,
constrained by bashfulness, it seemed, from his
manner of bending his head and plucking at her horse&#8217;s
mane.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not even officially engaged,&#8221; she denied, coldly,
not pitying his bashfulness at all, nor bent to assist him
in delivering what lay on the end of his tongue. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t pick up a sheepwoman and marry her off&ndash;&ndash;like
some old fool king&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid placed his hand over hers where it lay idly on
the saddle-horn, the reins loosely held. He leaned closer,
his eyes burning, his face near her own, so near that she
shrank back, and drew on her hand to come free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we need to wait three years to get
married, Joan,&#8221; he argued, his persuasive voice very
soft and tender. &#8220;If the old man saw I meant business&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Business!&#8221; scorned Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep business, I mean, Joan,&#8221; chidingly, a tincture
of injury in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sheep business,&#8221; said Joan, leaning far over to
look at the knotting of her cinch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, to settle down to it here and take it as it
comes, the way he got his start, he&#8217;d come across with
all the money we&#8217;d want to take a run out of here once
in a while and light things up. We ought to be gettin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the good out of it while we&#8217;ve got an edge on us, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan swung to the ground, threw a stirrup across the
saddle, and began to tighten her cinch. Reid alighted
with a word of protest, offering his hand for the work.
Joan ignored his proffer, with a little independent, altogether
scornful, toss of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find plenty of them ready to take you up,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;What&#8217;s the reason you have to stay right
here for three years, and then marry me, to make a
million dollars? Can&#8217;t you go anywhere else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man&#8217;s picked on this country because he
knows your dad, and he settled on you for the girl because
you got into his eye, just the way you&#8217;ve got into
mine, Joan. I was sore enough about it at first to throw
the money and all that went with it to the pigs, and
blow out of here. But that was before I saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Joan, in her pettish, discounting way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean every word of it, Joan. I can&#8217;t talk like&ndash;&ndash;like&ndash;&ndash;some
men&ndash;&ndash;my heart gets in the way, I guess, and
chokes me off. But I never saw a girl that I ever lost
sleep over till I saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan did not look at him as he drew nearer with his
words. She pulled the stirrup down, lifted her foot to
it, and stood so a second, hand on the pommel to mount.
And so she glanced round at him, standing near her
shoulder, his face flushed, a brightness in his eyes.</p>
<p>Quicker than thought Reid threw his arm about her
shoulders, drawing her to him, his hot cheek against her
own, his hot breath on her lips. Surging with indignation
of the mean advantage he had taken of her, Joan
freed her foot from the stirrup, twisting away from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
impending salute, her hand to Reid&#8217;s shoulder in a shove
that sent him back staggering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were more of a man than that!&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Joan; it rushed over me&ndash;&ndash;I
couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221; Reid&#8217;s voice shook as he spoke; he
stood with downcast eyes, the expression of contrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too fresh to keep!&#8221; Joan said, brushing her
face savagely with her hand where his cheek had pressed
it for a breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask you next time,&#8221; he promised, looking up between
what seemed hope and contrition. But there was
a mocking light in his sophisticated face, a greedy sneer
in his lustful eyes, which Joan could feel and see, although
she could not read to the last shameful depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it any more,&#8221; she warned, in the cool, even
voice of one sure of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have a right to kiss my future wife,&#8221; he
defended, a shadow of a smile on his thin lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a bit of use to go on harping on that,
Earl,&#8221; she said, in a way of friendly counsel, the incident
already past and trampled under foot, it seemed.
&#8220;If you want to stay here and work for dad, three
years or thirty years, I don&#8217;t care, but don&#8217;t count on
me. I guess if you go straight and prove you deserve
it, you&#8217;ll not need any girl to help you get the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be you&ndash;&ndash;nobody else, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then kiss your old million&ndash;&ndash;or whatever it is&ndash;&ndash;good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan lifted to the saddle as if swept into it by a wave,
and drew her reins tight, and galloped away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>TIM SULLIVAN BREAKS A CONTRACT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;And that will be the end of it,&#8221; said Tim Sullivan,
finality in his tone, his face stern, his manner
severe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve passed my word to old Malcolm that
you&#8217;ll have his boy, and have him you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy!&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;In experience he&#8217;s no lad, and I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve discovered
it,&#8221; said Tim, warming a little, speaking with
more softness, not without admiration for her penetration.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be the better able to look after you, and
see they don&#8217;t get his money away from him like some
simpleton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll get it, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim had arrived that morning from a near-by camp
as Joan was about to set out for Dad Frazer&#8217;s. From
his way of plunging abruptly into this matter, which he
never had discussed with her before, and his sharpness
and apparent displeasure with her, Joan knew that he
had seen Reid overnight. They were beside the sheep-wagon,
to a wheel of which Joan&#8217;s horse was tied, all
saddled and ready to mount. The sun was already high,
for Joan had helped Charley range the flock out for its
day&#8217;s grazing, and had put all things to rights in the
camp, anxious as her mind was over Mackenzie&#8217;s state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have you treat the lad like a beggar come
to ask of you, Joan; I&#8217;ll not have it at all. Be civil with
him; use him kindly when he speaks.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a thousand years older than I am; he knows
things that you never heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been whisperin&#8217; slanders of him in your
ear. He&#8217;s a fine lad, able to hold his own among men,
take &#8217;em where they&#8217;re found. Don&#8217;t you heed what the
jealous say about the boy, Joan; don&#8217;t you let it move
you at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have him if he brought his million in a
wheelbarrow and dumped it at my feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a million, as I hear it,&#8221; Tim corrected,
mildly, even a bit thoughtfully, &#8220;not more nor a half.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s only half as desirable,&#8221; smiled Joan, the
little gleam of humor striking into her gloomy hour
like a sudden ray of sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d run sheep till you was bent and gray, and
the rheumatiz&#8217; got set in your j&#8217;ints, me gerrel, before
you&#8217;d win to the half of half a million. Here it comes
to you while you&#8217;re young, with the keenness to relish it
and the free hand to spend the interest off of it, and sail
over the seas and see the world you&#8217;re longin&#8217; to know
and understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan&#8217;s hat hung on the saddle-horn, the morning wind
was trifling with light breath in her soft, wave-rippled
hair. Her brilliant necktie had been put aside for one
of narrower span and more sober hue, a blue with white
dots. The free ends of it blew round to her shoulder,
where they lay a moment before fluttering off to brush
her cheek, as if to draw by this slight friction some of
the color back into it that this troubled interview had
drained away.</p>
<p>She stood with her head high, her chin lifted, determination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
in her eyes. Thorned shrubs and stones had
left their marks on her strong boots, the little teeth of
the range had frayed the hem of her short cloth skirt,
but she was as fresh to see as a morning-glory in the
sun. Defiance outweighed the old cast of melancholy
that clouded her eyes; her lips were fixed in an expression
which was denial in itself as she stood looking into
the wind, her little brown hands clenched at her sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want that you should marry him, as I have arranged
it with old Malcolm,&#8221; said Tim, speaking slowly
to give it greater weight. &#8220;I have passed my word; let
that be the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a right to have a word, too. Nobody else
is as much concerned in it as me, Dad. You can&#8217;t put a
girl up and sell her like a sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no sale; it&#8217;s yourself that comes into the handlin&#8217;
of the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim took her up quickly on it, a gleam in his calculative
eye, as if he saw a convincing way opening ahead of
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it, Dad, as far as I&#8217;d go to please you;
I couldn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;never in this world! There&#8217;s something
about him&ndash;&ndash;something&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll wear off; &#8217;tis the strangeness of him, but three
years will bring him closer; it will wear away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll never wear away, because he isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;he isn&#8217;t
<i>clean</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean?&#8221; Tim repeated, turning in amazement as if
to seek a witness to such a preposterous charge. And
again: &#8220;Clean? He&#8217;s as fresh as a daisy, as clean as a
lamb.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way he seems to me,&#8221; she insisted, with conviction
that no argument would shake. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
any other name for it&ndash;&ndash;you can see it in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three year here will brace him up, Joan; he&#8217;ll come
to you as fresh as lumber out of the mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, all the wind in the world can&#8217;t blow it out of
him. I can&#8217;t do it, I&#8217;ll never do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And me with my word passed to old Malcolm!&#8221; Tim
seemed to grieve over it, and the strong possibility of
its repudiation; his face fell so long, his voice so accusing,
so low and sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not lose any money; you can square it up
with him some way, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been the example of a dutiful child to me,&#8221;
Tim said, turning to her, spreading his hands, the oil
of blarney in his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;ve took the work of a man
off of my hands since you were twelve year old, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; Joan nodded, a shading of sadness for
the lost years of her girlhood in her tone. She did not
turn to face him, her head high that way, her chin up,
her nose in the wind as if her assurance lay in its warm
scents, and her courage came on its caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been the gerrel that&#8217;s gone out in the storm
and the bitter blast to save the sheep, and stood by them
when their poor souls shook with the fright, and soothed
down their panic and saved their lives. You&#8217;ve been
the gerrel that&#8217;s worked the sheep over this range in
rain and shine, askin&#8217; me nothing, not a whimper or a
complaint out of ye&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been to me,
Joan. It&#8217;s been a hard life for a lass, it&#8217;s been a hard
and a lonesome life.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>Joan nodded, her head drooping just a little from its
proud lift. Tears were on her face; she turned it a bit
to hide them from his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mind the time, Joan, four years ago it was the
winter past, when you stood a full head shorter than
you stand today, when the range was snowed in, and
the sheep was unable to break the crust that froze over
it, and was huddlin&#8217; in the ca&ntilde;ons starving wi&#8217; the hunger
that we couldn&#8217;t ease? Heh&ndash;&ndash;ye mind that winter,
Joan, gerrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan nodded again, her chin trembling as it dropped
nearer to the fluttering necktie at her warm, round
throat. And the tears were coursing hotter, the well
of them open, the stone at the mouth of it rolled away,
the recollection of those harsh days almost too hard to
bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you mind how you read in the book from the
farmer college how a handful of corn a day would save
the life of a sheep, and tide it over the time of stress
and storm till it could find the grass in under the snow?
Ah-h, ye mind how you read it, Joan, and come ridin&#8217; to
tell me? And how you took the wagons and the teams
and drove that bitter length in wind and snow to old
Wellfleet&#8217;s place down on the river, and brought corn
that saved to me the lives of no less than twenty thousand
sheep? It&#8217;s not you and me, that&#8217;s gone through
these things side by side, that forgets them in the fair
days, Joan, my little darlin&#8217; gerrel. Them was hard
days, and you didn&#8217;t desert me and leave me to go
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan shook her head, the sob that she had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
smothering breaking from her in a sharp, riving cry.
Tim, feeling that he had softened her, perhaps, laid his
hand on her shoulder, and felt her body trembling under
the emotion that his slow recital of past hardships
had stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll not be that you&#8217;ll leave me in a hole now, Joan,&#8221;
he coaxed, stroking her hair back from her forehead, his
touch gentle as his heart could be when interest bent
it so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you that&ndash;&ndash;all those years that other girls
have to themselves, I mean, and all that work that made
me coarse and rough and kept me down in ignorance&ndash;&ndash;I
gave you out of my youth till the well of my giving has
gone dry. I can&#8217;t give what you ask today, Dad; I
can&#8217;t give you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Joan, take it easy a bit, draw your breath
on it, take it easy, gerrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan&#8217;s chin was up again, the tremor gone out of it,
the shudder of sorrow for the lost years stilled in her
beautiful, strong body. Her voice was steady when she
spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go on working, share and share alike with you,
like I&#8217;m doing now, or no share, no nothing, if you want
me to, if you need me to, but I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a hard master over you, my little Joan,&#8221; said
Tim, gently, as if torn by the thorn of regret for his
past blindness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were, but you didn&#8217;t mean to be. I don&#8217;t mind
it now, I&#8217;m still young enough to catch up on what I
missed&ndash;&ndash;I <i>am</i> catching up on it, every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now when it comes in my way to right it, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
make all your life easy to you, Joan, you put your back
up like a catamount and tear at the eyes of me like you&#8217;d
put them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be that way, Dad&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t you see I don&#8217;t
care for him? If I cared, he wouldn&#8217;t have to have any
money, and you wouldn&#8217;t have to argue with me, to make
me marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that stubborn you are!&#8221; said Tim, his softness
freezing over in a breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about it, Dad,&#8221; she pleaded, turning
to him, the tears undried on her cheeks, the sorrow of
the years he had made slow and heavy for her in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be talked about, it must be settled, now and
for good, Joan. I have plans for you, I have great
plans, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to change it now, I&#8217;m satisfied with the
arrangement we&#8217;ve made on the sheep, Dad. Let me go
on like I have been, studying my lessons and looking
after the sheep with Charley. I&#8217;m satisfied the way it
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve planned better things for you, Joan, better from
this day forward, and more to your heart. Mackenzie
is all well enough for teachin&#8217; a little school of childer,
but he&#8217;s not deep enough to be over the likes of you,
Joan. I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; I&#8217;ll send you to Cheyenne to the
sisters&#8217; college at the openin&#8217; of the term; very soon
now, you&#8217;ll be makin&#8217; ready for leavin&#8217; at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; said Joan, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you&#8217;d be taught the true speech of a lady, and
the twist of the tongue on French, and the nice little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
things you&#8217;ve missed here among the sheep, Joan darlin&#8217;,
and that neither me nor your mother nor John Mackenzie&ndash;&ndash;good
lad that he is, though mistaken at times,
woeful mistaken in his judgment of men&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t give
you, gerrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll stay here and work my way out with the
sheep,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>Tim was standing at her side, a bit behind her, and
she turned a little more as she denied him, her head so
high she might have been listening to the stars. He
looked at her with a deep flush coming into his brown
face, a frown narrowing his shrewd eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you that stubborn, now!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Tim, firing up, the ashes of deceit blowing
from the fire of his purpose at once, &#8220;you&#8217;ll take
what I offer or leave what you&#8217;ve got! I&#8217;ll have no more
shyin&#8217; and shillyin&#8217; out of you, and me with my word
passed to old Malcolm Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joan wheeled round, her face white, fright in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the sheep?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the sheep&ndash;&ndash;just that an&#8217; no less. Do as I&#8217;ll
have you do, and go on to school to be put in polish for
the wife of a gentleman, or give up the flock and the interest
I allowed you in the increase, and go home and
scrape the pots and pans!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d never do that, Dad&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;d never break your
word with me, after all I&#8217;ve gone through for you, and
take my lambs away from me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, just so,&#8221; said Tim. But he did not have
the courage to look her in the face as he said it, turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
away like a stubborn man who had no cause beneath his
feet, but who meant to be stubborn and unjust against
it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will so, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your word to Malcolm Reid means a whole lot to
you, but your word to me means nothing!&#8221; Joan spoke
in bitterness, her voice vibrating with passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the same,&#8221; he defended weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can rob your daughter&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence! I&#8217;ll not have it!&#8221; Tim could look at her
now, having a reason, as he saw it. There was a solid
footing to his pretense at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cheap way to get a thousand lambs,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve got &#8217;em cheap!&#8221; said Tim, red in his fury.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll flout me and mock me and throw my offers for
your good in my face, and speak disrespectful&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke the truth, no word but the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no more out o&#8217; ye! It&#8217;s home you go, and
it&#8217;s there you&#8217;ll stay till you can trim your tongue and
bend your mind to obey my word!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got no right to take my sheep; you went into
a contract with me, you ought to respect it as much as
your word to anybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no sheep, you had none. Home you&#8217;ll go,
this minute, and leave the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll die, every one of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence, ye! Get on that horse and go home, and
I&#8217;ll be there after you to tend to your case, my lady! I&#8217;ll
have none of this chargin&#8217; me to thievery out of the
mouth of one of my childer&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll have none of it!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve got a better name for it&ndash;&ndash;you and old
man Reid!&#8221; Joan scorned, her face still white with the
cold, deep anger of her wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tame you, or I&#8217;ll break your heart!&#8221; said Tim,
doubly angry because the charge she made struck deep.
He glowered at her, mumbling and growling as if considering
immediate chastisement.</p>
<p>Joan said no more, but her hand trembled, her limbs
were weak under her weight with the collapse of all her
hopes, as she untied and mounted her horse. The ruin
of her foundations left her in a daze, to which the surging,
throbbing of a sense of deep, humiliating, shameful
wrong, added the obscuration of senses, the confusion of
understanding. She rode to the top of the hill, and
there the recollection of Mackenzie came to her like the
sharp concern for a treasure left behind.</p>
<p>She reined in after crossing the hilltop, and debated
a little while on what course to pursue. But only for a
little while. Always she had obeyed her father, under
injunctions feeling and unfeeling, just and unjust. He
was not watching to see that she obeyed him now, knowing
well that she would do as he had commanded.</p>
<p>With bent head, this first trouble and sorrow of her
life upon her, and with the full understanding in her
heart that all which had passed before this day was
nothing but the skimming of light shadows across her
way, Joan rode homeward. A mile, and the drooping
shoulders stiffened; the bent head lifted; Joan looked
about her at the sun making the sheeplands glad. A
mile, and the short breath of anger died out of her
panting lungs, the long, deep inspiration of restored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
balance in its place; the pale shade left her cold cheeks,
where the warm blood came again.</p>
<p>Joan, drawing new hope from the thoughts which
came winging to her, looked abroad over the sunlit
sheeplands, and smiled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>PHANTOMS OF FEVER</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;That was ten or twelve days ago,&#8221; Dad explained,
when Mackenzie found himself blinking understandingly
at the sunlight through the open end of the
sheep-wagon one morning. &#8220;You was chawed and beat
up till you was hangin&#8217; together by threads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was as weak as a young mouse. He closed
his eyes and lay thinking back over those days of delirium
through which a gleam of understanding fell only
once in a while. Dad evidently believed that he was well
now, from his manner and speech, although Mackenzie
knew that if his life depended on rising and walking
from the wagon he would not be able to redeem it at the
price.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to remember a woman around me a good
deal,&#8221; he said, not trusting himself to look at Dad. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;was it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt his face flush, and cursed his weakness,
but he could not pronounce the name that filled his
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was Rabbit,&#8221; said Dad, catching him up without
the slightest understanding of his stammering.
&#8220;She&#8217;s been stickin&#8217; to you night and day. I tell you,
John, them Indians can&#8217;t be beat doctorin&#8217; a man up
when he&#8217;s been chawed up by a animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank her,&#8221; Mackenzie said, feeling his
heart swing very low indeed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t see much of her now since you&#8217;ve come to
your head, I reckon she&#8217;ll be passin&#8217; you over to me to
look after. She&#8217;s shy that way. Yes, sir, any time I
git bit up by man or beast, or shot up or knifed, I&#8217;ll take
Rabbit ahead of any doctor you can find. Them Indians
they know the secrets of it. I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid
to stand and let a rattlesnake bite me till it fainted if
Rabbit was around. She can cure it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mackenzie knew from the odor of his bandages
that Rabbit was not depending on her Indian knowledge
in his case, or not entirely so. There was the odor of
carbolic acid, and he was conscious all along that his
head had been shaved around the wound in approved
surgical fashion. He reasoned that Rabbit went about
prepared with the emergency remedies of civilization,
and put it down to her schooling at the Catholic sisters&#8217;
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there anybody&ndash;&ndash;did anybody else come around?&#8221;
Mackenzie inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim&#8217;s been by a couple of times. Oh, well&ndash;&ndash;Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Joan,&#8221; said Mackenzie, trying to make it sound
as if he had no concern in Joan at all. But his voice
trembled, and life came bounding up in him again with
glad, wild spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was over the day after you got hurt, but she
ain&#8217;t been back,&#8221; said Dad, with such indifference that
he must have taken it for granted that Mackenzie held
no tenderness for her, indeed. &#8220;I met Charley yesterday;
he told me Joan was over home. Mary&#8217;s out here
with him&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s the next one to Joan, you know.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s day clouded; his sickness fell over him
again, taking the faint new savor out of life. Joan was
indifferent; she did not care. Then hope came on its
white wings to excuse her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she sick?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&ndash;&ndash;Mary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan. Is she all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I was married to her I&#8217;d give up hopes of
ever bein&#8217; left a widower. That girl&#8217;s as healthy as a
burro&ndash;&ndash;yes, and she&#8217;ll outlive one, I&#8217;ll bet money, and
I&#8217;ve heard of &#8217;em livin&#8217; eighty years down in Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad did not appear to be cognizant of Mackenzie&#8217;s
weakness. According to the old man&#8217;s pathology a man
was safe when he regained his head out of the delirium
of fever. All he needed then was cheering up, and Dad
did not know of any better way of doing that than by
talking. So he let himself go, and Mackenzie shut his
eyes to the hum of the old fellow&#8217;s voice, the sound beating
on his ears like wind against closed doors.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dad&#8217;s chatter ceased. The silence was as
welcome as the falling of a gale to a man at sea in an
open boat. Mackenzie heard Dad leaving the wagon in
cautious haste, and opened his eyes to see. Rabbit
was beside him with a bowl of savory-smelling broth,
which she administered to him with such gentle deftness
that Mackenzie could not help believing Dad had libeled
her in his story of the accident that had left its mark
upon her face.</p>
<p>Rabbit would not permit her patient to talk, denying
him with uplifted finger and shake of head when he attempted
it. She did not say a word during her visit, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
her manner was only gentle, neither timid nor
shy.</p>
<p>Rabbit was a short woman, turning somewhat to
weight, a little gray in her black hair, but rather due
to trouble than age, Mackenzie believed. Her skin was
dark, her face bright and intelligent, but stamped with
the meekness which is the heritage of women of her race.
The burn had left her marked as Dad had said, the scar
much lighter than the original skin, but it was not such
a serious disfigurement that a man would be justified in
leaving her for it as Dad had done.</p>
<p>When Rabbit went out she drew a mosquito netting
over the opening in the back of the wagon. Mackenzie
was certain that Dad had libeled her after that. There
was not a fly in the wagon to pester him, and he knew
that the opening in the front end had been similarly
screened, although he could not turn to see. Grateful
to Rabbit, with the almost tearful tenderness that a sick
man feels for those who have ministered kindly to his
pain, Mackenzie lay with his thoughts that first day of
consciousness after his tempestuous season of delirium.</p>
<p>They were not pleasant thoughts for a man whose
blood was not yet cool. As they surged and hammered
in his brain his fever flashed again, burning in his eyes
like a desert wind. Something had happened to alienate
Joan.</p>
<p>That was the burden of it as the sun mounted with
his fever, heating the enclosed wagon until it was an
oven. Something had happened to alienate Joan. He
did not believe her weak enough, fickle enough, to yield
to the allurements of Reid&#8217;s prospects. They must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
slandered him and driven her away with lies. Reid
must have slandered him; there was the stamp of slander
in his wide, thin mouth.</p>
<p>It would be many days, it might be weeks, before he
could go abroad on the range again to set right whatever
wrong had been done him. Then it would be too
late. Surely Joan could not take his blunder into Carlson&#8217;s
trap in the light of an unpardonable weakness;
she was not so sheep-blind as that. Something had been
done outside any act of his own to turn her face and
her sympathies away.</p>
<p>Consumed in impatience to be up, anxiety for the delay,
Mackenzie lay the throbbing day through like a disabled
engine spending its vain power upon a broken
shaft. Kind Rabbit came frequently to give him drink,
to bathe his forehead, to place a cool cloth over his
burning eyes. But Dad did not come again. How
much better for his peace if the garrulous old rascal had
not come at all!</p>
<p>And then with the thought of Joan there came mingling
the vexing wonder of the train of violence that
had attended him into the sheeplands. He had come
there to be a master over flocks, not expecting to encounter
any unfriendly force save the stern face of nature.
He had begun to muddle and meddle at the outset;
he had continued to muddle, if not meddle, to the
very end.</p>
<p>For this would be the end. No sheepman would countenance
a herder who could not take care of his flock in
summer weather on a bountiful range. His day was
done in that part of the country so far as his plans of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
becoming a sharing herdsman went. Earl Reid, a thin,
anemic lad fresh from city life, had come in and made
much more a figure of a man.</p>
<p>So his fever boiled under the fuel of his humiliating
thoughts. The wagon was a bake-oven, but there was
no sweat in him to cool his parching skin. He begged
Rabbit to let him go and lie under the wagon, where the
wind could blow over him, but she shook her head in
denial and pressed him down on the bunk. Then she
gave him a drink that had the bitterness of opium in it,
and he threw down his worrying snarl of thoughts, and
slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING MARY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard tell of sheepmen workin&#8217; Swan&#8217;s
dodge on one another, but I never took no
stock in it, because I never believed even a sheepman was
fool enough to let anybody put a thing like that over on
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sheepman oughtn&#8217;t to be,&#8221; Mackenzie said, in the
bitterness of defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan knew you was an easy feller, and green to the
ways of them tricky sheepmen,&#8221; said Dad. &#8220;You let
him off in that first fight with a little crack on the head
when you&#8217;d ought to &#8217;a&#8217; laid him out for good, and you
let Hector Hall go that time you took his guns away
from him. Folks in here never could understand that;
they say it was like a child playin&#8217; with a rattlesnake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; Mackenzie agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swan thought he could run them sheep of his over
on you and take away five or six hundred more than he
brought, and I guess he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; done it if it hadn&#8217;t been
for Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way, Dad. I sure was easy, to fall
into his trap the way I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie was able to get about again, and was gaining
strength rapidly. He and Dad were in the shade of
some willows along the creek, where Mackenzie stretched
in the indolent relaxation of convalescence, Dad smoking
his miserable old pipe close at hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>And miserable is the true word for Dad&#8217;s pipe, for it
was miserable indeed, and miserable the smell that came
out of it, going there full steam on a hot afternoon of
early autumn. Dad always carefully reamed out the
first speck of carbon that formed in his pipe, and kept
it reamed out with boring blade of his pocket knife. He
wanted no insulation against nicotine, and the strength
thereof; he was not satisfied unless the fire burned into
the wood, and drew the infiltrations of strong juice
therefrom. When his charge of tobacco burned out,
and the fire came down to this frying, sizzling abomination
of smells at last, Dad beamed, enjoying it as a sort
of dessert to a delightful repast of strong smoke.</p>
<p>Dad was enjoying his domestic felicity to the full
these days of Mackenzie&#8217;s convalescence. Rabbit was
out with the sheep, being needed no longer to attend the
patient, leaving Dad to idle as he pleased. His regret
for the one-eyed widow seemed to have passed, leaving
no scar behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim don&#8217;t take no stock in it that Swan planned before
to do you out of a lot of your sheep. He was by
here this morning while you was wanderin&#8217; around somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was by, was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah; he was over to see Reid&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s sent him a new
wagon over there. Tim says you and Swan must both
&#8217;a&#8217; been asleep and let the two bands stray together, and
of course it was human for Swan to want to take away
more than he brought. Well, it was sheepman, anyhow,
if it wasn&#8217;t human.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Sullivan say that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s what I say. I know &#8217;em; I know &#8217;em to
the bone. Reid knew how many sheep him and you had,
and he stuck out for &#8217;em like a little man. More to that
feller than I ever thought he had in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mackenzie agreed. He lay stretched on his
back, squinting at the calm-weather clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah; Tim says both of you fellers must &#8217;a&#8217; been
asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;ll fire me when he sees me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon he will. Tim takes it as a kind of
a joke, and he&#8217;s as proud as all git-out of the way Reid
stacked up. If that boy hadn&#8217;t happened up when he
did, Swan he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; soaked you another one with that gun
of yourn and put you out for good. They say that kid
waltzed Swan around there and made him step like he
was standin&#8217; on a red-hot stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody see him doing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon anybody did. But he must &#8217;a&#8217;
done it, all right, Swan didn&#8217;t git a head of sheep that
didn&#8217;t belong to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny how Reid arrived on the second,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, reflecting over it as a thing he had pondered
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s natural you&#8217;d feel a little jealous of him,
John&ndash;&ndash;most any feller would. But I don&#8217;t think he
had any hand in it with Swan to run him in on you, if
that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re drivin&#8217; at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It never crossed my mind,&#8221; said Mackenzie, but not
with his usual regard for the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him, and I never did like him, but you&#8217;ve
got to hand it to him for grit and nerve.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Has he got over the lonesomeness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s got a right to if he ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a right to? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad chuckled, put both hands to the back of his head,
smoothed his long, bright hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon you knew when you was teachin&#8217; Joan
you was goin&#8217; to all that trouble for that feller,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sullivan told me him and old man Reid had made an
agreement concerning the young folks,&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
a sickness of dread over him for what he believed
he was about to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tim told you, did he? Never said nothin&#8217; to me
about it till this mornin&#8217;. He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to send Joan off
to the sisters&#8217; school down at Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat up, saying nothing for a good while.
He sat looking at the ground, buried in his thoughts as
deep as a grave. Dad turned curious eyes upon him,
but yet not eyes which probed to the secret of his heart
or weighed his loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;couldn&#8217;t teach her enough to keep
her here,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could teach her a danged sight more than she
could remember. I think Tim and her had a spat, but
I&#8217;m only guessin&#8217; from what Charley said. Reid was at
the bottom of it, I&#8217;ll bet a purty. That feller was afraid
you and Joan might git to holdin&#8217; hands out here on the
range so much together, heads a touchin&#8217; over them
books.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie heard the old man as the wind. No, he had
not taught Joan enough to keep her in the sheeplands;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
she had not read deeply enough into that lesson which
he once spoke of as the easiest to learn and the hardest
to forget. Joan&#8217;s desire for life in the busy places had
overbalanced her affection for him. Spat or no spat,
she would have come to see him more than once in his
desperate struggle against death if she had cared.</p>
<p>He could not blame her. There was not much in a
man who had made a failure of even sheepherding to
bind a maid to him against the allurements of the world
that had been beckoning her so long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim said he&#8217;d be around to see you late this evening
or tomorrow. He&#8217;s went over to see how Mary and
Charley&#8217;re makin&#8217; out, keepin&#8217; his eye on &#8217;em like he
suspicioned they might kill a lamb once in a while to go
with their canned beans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mackenzie, abstractedly.</p>
<p>Dad looked at him with something like scorn for his
inattention to such an engrossing subject. Mackenzie
was not looking his way; his thoughts seemed to be a
thousand leagues from Tim Sullivan&#8217;s range and the
lambs on it, let them be alive or slaughtered to go with
canned beans.</p>
<p>But Joan would come back to the sheeplands, as she
said everybody came back to them who once had lived
in their silences and breathed their wide freedom. She
would come back, not lost to him, but regained, her lesson
learned, not to go away with that youth who wore
the brand of old sins on his face. So hope came to lift
him and assure him, just when he felt the somber cloud
of the lonesomeness beginning to engulf his soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Tim don&#8217;t like it, but me and Rabbit butcher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
lambs right along, and we&#8217;ll keep on doin&#8217; it as long as
we run sheep. A man&#8217;s got to have something besides
the grub he gits out of tin cans. That ain&#8217;t no life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Dad. I&#8217;d been in a hole on the side
of some hill before now if it hadn&#8217;t been for the broth
and lamb stew Rabbit fed me. There&#8217;s nothing like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You right they ain&#8217;t!&#8221; said Dad, forgetting Mackenzie&#8217;s
lapse of a little while before. &#8220;I save the hides
and turn &#8217;em over to him, and he ain&#8217;t got no kick. If I
was them children I&#8217;d butcher me a lamb once a week,
anyhow. But maybe they don&#8217;t like it&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.
I&#8217;ve known sheepmen that couldn&#8217;t go mutton, never
tasted it from one year to another. May be the smell
of sheep when you git a lot of &#8217;em in a shearin&#8217; pen and
let &#8217;em stand around for a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what had they told Joan that she would go away
without a word, leaving him in a sickness from which
he might never have turned again? Something had been
done to alienate her, some crafty libel had been poured
into her ears. Let that be as it might, Joan would come
back, and he would wait in the sheeplands for her, and
take her by the hand and clear away her troubled
doubts. The comfort of this thought would drive the
lonesomeness away.</p>
<p>He would wait. If not in Tim Sullivan&#8217;s hire, then
with a little flock of his own, independent of the lords
of sheep. He would rather remain with Sullivan, having
more to prove now of his fitness to become a flockmaster
than at the beginning. Sullivan&#8217;s doubt of him would
have increased; the scorn which he could not quite cover
before would be open now and expressed. They had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
use in the sheeplands for a man who fought and lost.
They would respect him more if he refused to fight at
all.</p>
<p>Dad was still talking, rubbing his fuzzy chin with reflective
hand, looking along the hillside to where Rabbit
stood watch over the sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim wanted to buy that big yellow collie from Rabbit,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Offered her eighty dollars. Might as
well try to buy me from that woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect she&#8217;d sell you quicker than she would the
collie, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish she would sell that dang animal, he never has
made friends with me. The other one and me we git
along all right, but that feller he&#8217;s been educated on the
scent of that old vest, and he&#8217;ll be my enemy to my last
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lucky man to have a wife like Rabbit, anyhow,
dog or no dog. It&#8217;s hard for me to believe she
ever took a long swig out of a whisky jug, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, me and Rabbit was disputin&#8217; about that a
day or so ago. Funny how I seem to &#8217;a&#8217; got mixed up
on that, but I guess it wasn&#8217;t Rabbit that used to pull
my jug too hard. That must &#8217;a&#8217; been a Mexican woman
I was married to one time down by El Paso.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet money it was the Mexican woman. How did
Rabbit get her face scalded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She tripped and fell in the hog-scaldin&#8217; vat like I
told you, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked at him severely, almost ready to
take the convalescent&#8217;s prerogative and quarrel with his
best friend.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the straight of it, you old hide-bound sinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad changed hands on his chin, fingering his beard
with scraping noise, eyes downcast as if a little ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it was me that took a snort too many out
of the jug that day, John,&#8221; he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it was. And Rabbit tripped and fell into
the tub trying to save you from it, did she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, John, them fellers said that was about the
straight of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be hung for running away from her,
you old hard-shelled scoundrel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad took it in silence, and sat rubbing it into his
beard like a liniment. After a while he rose, squinted
his eye up at the sun with a quick turn of his head like
a chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon every man&#8217;s done something he ought to be
hung for,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That ended it. Dad went off to begin supper, there
being potatoes to cook. Sullivan had sent a sack of
that unusual provender out to camp to help Mackenzie
get his strength back in a hurry, he said.</p>
<p>Tim himself put in his appearance at camp a little
later in the day, when the scent of lamb stew that Dad
had in the kettle was streaming over the hills. Tim
could not resist it, for it was seasoned with wild onions
and herbs, and between the four of them they left the
pot as clean as Jack Spratt&#8217;s platter, the dogs making
a dessert on the bones.</p>
<p>Dad and Rabbit went away presently to assemble the
sheep for the night, and Tim let his Irish tongue wag as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
it would. He was in lively and generous mood, making
a joke of the mingling of the flocks which had come so
dearly to Mackenzie&#8217;s account. He bore himself like a
man who had gained something, indeed, and that was the
interpretation put on it by Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Tim led up to what he had come to discuss presently,
beaming with stew and satisfaction when he spoke of
Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you understand, John, I don&#8217;t want you
to think it was any slam on you that I took Joan off
the range and made her stop takin&#8217; her book lessons
from you. That girl got too fresh with me, denyin&#8217; my
authority to marry her to the man I&#8217;ve picked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie nodded, a great warmth of understanding
glowing in his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to feel that it was any reflection
on your ability as a teacher, you understand, John;
I don&#8217;t want you to look at it that way at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Mackenzie echoed, quite sincerely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could &#8217;a&#8217; had her, for all the difference it was
to me, if I hadn&#8217;t made that deal with Reid. A man&#8217;s
got to stick to his word, you know, lad, and not have it
thwarted by any little bobbin of a girl. I&#8217;d as soon
you&#8217;d have one of my girls as any man I know, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I could see how it might turn out between
you and Joan if she kept on ridin&#8217; over to have lessons
from you every day. You can&#8217;t blame Earl if he saw it
the same way, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t his yet,&#8221; said Mackenzie confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here, John&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Sullivan spoke with a certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
sharpness, a certain hardness of dictation in his
tone, &#8220;you&#8217;d just as well stand out of it and let Earl
have her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s heart swung so high it seemed to brush
the early stars. It was certain now that Joan had not
gone home without a fight, and that she had not remained
there throughout his recovery from his wounds
without telling protest. More confidently than before
he repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t his yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll never get a sheep from me if she marries any
other man&ndash;&ndash;not one lone ewe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you value her in sheep?&#8221; Mackenzie
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get half a million dollars or more with Earl.
It would take a lot of sheep to amount to half a million,
John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mackenzie, with the indifference of a man
who did not have any further interest in the case, seeing
himself outbid. &#8220;That&#8217;s higher than I&#8217;ll ever be able
to go. All right; let him have her.&#8221; But beneath his
breath he added the condition: &#8220;If he can get her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit I like to see a man show!&#8221; Tim
commended. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame a man for marryin&#8217; into
a sheep ranch if he can&ndash;&ndash;I call him smart&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;d just
as soon you as any man&#8217;d marry one of my girls, as I
said, John. But you know, lad, a man can&#8217;t have them
that&#8217;s sealed, as the Mormons say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; Mackenzie agreed, and the more
heartily because it was sincere. If he grinned a little to
himself, Tim did not note it in the dusk.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s my Mary; she&#8217;s seventeen; she&#8217;ll be a
woman in three years more, and she&#8217;ll make two of Joan
when she fills out. My Mary would make the fine wife
for a lad like you, John, and I&#8217;ll give you five thousand
sheep the day you marry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; the day I marry Mary I&#8217;ll claim five thousand
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie said it so quickly, so positively, that Tim
glowed and beamed as never before. He slapped the
simpleton of a schoolmaster who had come into the
sheeplands to be a great sheepman on the back with
hearty hand, believing he had swallowed hook and all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done! The day you marry Mary you&#8217;ll have your
five thousand sheep along wi&#8217; her! I pass you my word,
and it goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands on it, Mackenzie as solemn as
though making a covenant in truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day I marry Mary,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be three years before she&#8217;s old enough to take
up the weight of carryin&#8217; babies, and of course you understand
you&#8217;ll have to wait on her, lad. A man can&#8217;t
jump into these things the way he buys a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go right on workin&#8217; for me like you are,&#8221; pursued
Tim, drunk on his bargain as he thought it to be,
&#8220;drawin&#8217; your pay like any hand, without favors asked
or given, takin&#8217; the knocks as they come to you, in
weather good and bad. That&#8217;ll be a better way than
goin&#8217; in shares on a band next spring like we talked;
it&#8217;ll be better for you, lad; better for you and Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Mackenzie assented.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; only of your own interests, you see, lad,
the same as if you was my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim patted Mackenzie&#8217;s shoulder again, doubtless
warm to the bottom of his sheep-blind heart over the
prospect of a hand to serve him three years who would
go break-neck and hell-for-leather, not counting consequences
in his blind and simple way, or weather or hardships
of any kind. For there was Mary, and there were
five thousand sheep. As for Joan, she was out of Tim&#8217;s
reckoning any longer. He had a new Jacob on the line,
and he was going to play him for all he was worth.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn yet,&#8221; Mackenzie
agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have, you have that,&#8221; said Tim with fatherly
tenderness, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll learn it like a book. I always
said from the day you come you had in you the makin&#8217;
of a sheepman. Some are quick and some are slow, but
the longer it takes to learn the harder it sticks. It&#8217;s
been that way wi&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the rule of the world, they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is; it is so. And you can put up a good fight,
even though you may not always hold your own; you&#8217;ll
be the lad to wade through it wi&#8217; your head up and the
mornin&#8217; light on your face. Sure you will, boy. I&#8217;ll be
tellin&#8217; Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d wait a while,&#8221; Mackenzie said, gently, as a man
who was very soft in his heart, indeed. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather we&#8217;d
grow into it, you know, easy, by gentle stages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, lad, right you are. Leave young
hearts to find their own way&ndash;&ndash;they can&#8217;t miss it if
there&#8217;s nobody between them. I&#8217;ll say no word to Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
at all, but you have leave to go and see her as often as
you like, lad, and the sooner you begin the better, to
catch her while she&#8217;s young. How&#8217;s your hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think you&#8217;re able, I&#8217;ll put you back with
the sheep you had. I&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; Reid over to the ranch
to put him in charge of the hospital band.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m able to handle them now, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But take your time, take it easy. Reid gets on with
Swan, bein&#8217; more experienced with men than you, I
guess. Well, a schoolteacher don&#8217;t meet men the way
other people do; he&#8217;s shut up with the childer all the
day, and he gets so he measures men by them. That
won&#8217;t do on the sheep range, lad. But I guess you&#8217;re
findin&#8217; it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m learning a little, right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve got the makin&#8217; of a sheepman in you;
I said you had it in you the first time I put my eyes on
your face. Well, I&#8217;ll be leavin&#8217; you now, lad. And remember
the bargain about my Mary. You&#8217;ll be a sheepman
in your own way the day you marry her. When a
man&#8217;s marryin&#8217; a sheep ranch what difference is it to
him whether it&#8217;s a Mary or a Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No difference&ndash;&ndash;when he&#8217;s marrying a sheep ranch,&#8221;
Mackenzie returned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>MORE ABOUT MARY</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie took Tim at his word two days after
their interview, and went visiting Mary. He
made the journey across to her range more to try his
legs than to satisfy his curiosity concerning the substitute
for Joan so cunningly offered by Tim in his
Laban-like way. He was pleased to find that his legs
bore him with almost their accustomed vigor, and surprised
to see the hills beginning to show the yellow
blooms of autumn. His hurts in that last encounter
with Swan Carlson and his dogs had bound him in camp
for three weeks.</p>
<p>Mary was a smiling, talkative, fair-haired girl, bearing
the foundation of a generous woman. She had none
of the shyness about her that might be expected in a
lass whose world had been the sheep range, and this
Mackenzie put down to the fact of her superior social
position, as fixed by the size of Tim Sullivan&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Conscious of this eminence above those who dwelt in
sheep-wagons or log houses by the creek-sides, Tim&#8217;s
girls walked out into their world with assurance. Tim
had done that much for them in rearing his mansion on
the hilltop, no matter what he had denied them of educational
refinements. Joan had gone hungry on this
distinction; she had developed the bitterness that comes
from the seeds of loneliness. This was lacking in Mary,
who was all smiles, pink and white in spite of sheeplands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
winds and suns. Mary was ready to laugh with
anybody or at anybody, and hop a horse for a twenty-mile
ride to a dance any night you might name.</p>
<p>Mackenzie made friends with her in fifteen minutes,
and had learned at the end of half an hour that friend
was all he might ever hope to be even if he had come
with any warmer notions in his breast. Mary was engaged
to be married. She told him so, as one friend to
another, pledging him to secrecy, showing a little ring
on a white ribbon about her neck. Her Corydon was a
sheepman&#8217;s son who lived beyond the Sullivan ranch,
and could dance like a butterfly and sing songs to the
banjo in a way to melt the heart of any maid. So
Mary said, but in her own way, with blushes, and wide,
serious eyes.</p>
<p>Mackenzie liked Mary from the first ingenuous word,
and promised to hold her secret and help her to happiness
in any way that a man might lift an honorable
hand. And he smiled when he recalled Tim Sullivan&#8217;s
word about catching them young. Surely a man had
to be stirring early in the day to catch them in the
sheeplands. Youth would look out for its own there,
as elsewhere. Tim Sullivan was right about it there.
He was wiser than he knew.</p>
<p>Mary was dressed as neatly as Joan always dressed
for her work with the sheep. And she wore a little black
crucifix about her neck on another ribbon which she had
no need to conceal. When she touched it she smiled and
smiled, and not for the comfort of the little cross,
Mackenzie understood, but in tenderness for what lay
beneath it, and for the shepherd lad who gave it. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
was a beauty in it for him that made the glad day
brighter.</p>
<p>This fresh, sprightly generation would redeem the
sheeplands, and change the business of growing sheep,
he said. The isolation would go out of that life; running
sheep would be more like a business than a penance
spent in heartache and loneliness. The world could not
come there, of course. It had no business there; it
should not come. But they would go to it, those young
hearts, behold its wonders, read its weaknesses, and
return. And there would be no more straining of the
heart in lonesomeness such as Joan had borne, and no
more discontent to be away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d marry Joan,&#8221; said Mary, with a
sympathetic little sigh. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like Earl Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary?&#8221; said Mackenzie. Mary looked up inquiringly.
&#8220;Can you keep a secret for me, Mary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> going to marry Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve got it all settled? Did Joan wear your
ring when she went home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t wear my ring, Mary, but she would
have worn it if I&#8217;d seen her before she was sent away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were at the bottom of it, John,&#8221; the
wise Mary said. &#8220;You know, dad&#8217;s taken her sheep
away from her, and she had a half-interest in at least a
thousand head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that, but it will not make any difference
to Joan and me. But why hasn&#8217;t she been over to
see me, Mary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dad&#8217;s sore at her because she put her foot down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
flat when she heard it was fixed for her to marry Earl.
She told dad to take his sheep and go to the devil&ndash;&ndash;she
was going to go away and work somewhere else. He
made her go home and stay there like a rabbit in a box&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&#8217;t
let her have a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; I might have known it. I wonder if she
knows I&#8217;m up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows, all right. Charley slips word to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley&#8217;s a good fellow, and so are you,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, giving Mary his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get her, and it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Mary declared,
in great confidence. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take more than bread and
water to tame Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all they&#8217;re giving her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dad&#8217;s idea of punishment&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s put most of
us on bread and water one time or another. But
mother has ideas of her own what a kid ought to have
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary smiled over the recollection, and Mackenzie
joined her. Joan would not grow thin with that mother
on the job.</p>
<p>They talked over the prospects ahead of Joan and
himself in the most comfortable way, leaving nothing
unsaid that hope could devise or courage suggest. A
long time Mackenzie remained with his little sister, who
would have been dear to him for her own sweet sake if
she had not been dearer because of her blood-tie to
Joan. When he was leaving, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody gets curious about my coming over to see
you, Mary, you might let them think I&#8217;m making love to
you. It would help both of us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Mary turned her eyes without moving her head, looking
at him across her nose in the arch way she had, and
smiled with a deep knowingness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>They let it go at that, understanding each other very
well indeed.</p>
<p>Mackenzie returned to Dad&#8217;s camp thinking that the
way to becoming a flockmaster was a checkered one, and
filled with more adventures, harsh and gentle, than he
ever had believed belonged to his apportionment in life.
But he could not blame Tim Sullivan for placing Reid
above him in rating on account of the encounters they
had shared, or for bending down a bit in his manner, or
taking him for a soft one who could be led into long
labors on the promise of an uncertain reward.</p>
<p>Truly, he had been only second best all the way
through, save for that &#8220;lucky blow,&#8221; as Tim called it,
that had laid Swan out in the first battle. Now Swan
and he were quits, a blow on each side, nobody debtor
any more, and Reid was away ahead of anybody who
had figured in the violence that Mackenzie had brought
into the sheeplands with him as an unwelcome stranger
lets in a gust of wind on a winter night.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, the vocation of sheepman never
appeared so full of attractive possibilities to Mackenzie
as it looked that hour. All his old calculations were revived,
his first determination proved to him how deeply
it had taken root. He had come into the sheep country
to be a flockmaster, and a flockmaster he would be. Because
he was fighting his way up to it only confirmed
him in the belief that he was following a destined course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and that he should cut a better figure in the end, somehow,
than he had made at the beginning.</p>
<p>Tim Sullivan thought him simple; he looked at him
with undisguised humor in his eyes, not taking the
trouble to turn his back when he laughed. And they
had taken Joan away out of his hands, like a gold-piece
snatched from a child. But that was more to his credit
than his disgrace, for it proved that they feared him
more than they scorned him, let them laugh as they
might.</p>
<p>But it was time for him to begin putting the credits
over on the other side of the book. Mackenzie took it
up with Dad Frazer that evening, Rabbit sitting by in
her quiet way with a nod and a smile now and then when
directly addressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re able to go over there and let
that feller off,&#8221; Dad objected. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell about
Swan; he may come round lookin&#8217; for more trouble, and
you not half the man you was before him and that dog
chawed you up that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll make out, Dad. I&#8217;ll keep my eyes open
this time, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not be able to slip up on you any more,
but if he crowds a fuss where&#8217;ll you be at, with that hand
hardly able to hold a gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be different this time if he does. I&#8217;m going
back to the sheep in the morning, Dad. I&#8217;ve got to get
busy, and keep busy if I ever make good at this game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad grunted around his pipestem, his charge being
burned down to the wood, and the savor too sweet on
his tongue to lose even a whiff by giving room for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
word in the door of his mouth. Presently the fire fried
and blubbered down in the pipe to the last atrocious
smell, and there followed the noise of more strong twist-tobacco
being milled between the old shepherd&#8217;s rasping
palms. Rabbit toddled off to bed without a word; Dad
put a match to his new charge, the light making him
blink, discovering his curiously sheared face with its
picturesque features strong, its weakness under the
shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you think of Mary?&#8221; he inquired, free to
discuss the ladies, now Rabbit was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary&#8217;s a little bit of all right, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and not such a little bit, either. Mary&#8217;s some
chunk of a girl; she&#8217;ll grow up to a woman that suits
my eye. You could do worse than set your cap for that
little lady, it seems to me, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any man could. She&#8217;s got a lively eye, and wise
head, too, if I&#8217;m not away off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks soft when you first glance her, but she&#8217;s
as deep as a well. Mary ain&#8217;t the build of a girl that
fools a man and throws him down. Now, you take Joan,
a kind of a high-headed touch-me-not, with that gingerbread
hair and them eyes that don&#8217;t ever seem to be in
fifty-five mile of you when you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; to her. I tell
you, the man that marries her&#8217;s got trouble up his
sleeve. He&#8217;ll wake up some morning and find her gone
off with some other man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not satisfied with what she&#8217;s got, always lookin&#8217; off
over the hill like a breachy cow calculatin&#8217; on how much
better the grazin&#8217;d be if she could hop the fence and go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
tearin&#8217; off over there. Joan ain&#8217;t the kind that settles
down to nuss babies and make a man a home. Mary is.
That&#8217;s the difference between them two girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right about it, Dad&ndash;&ndash;I expect you
are. You ought to know women if any man does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, neither one of &#8217;em ain&#8217;t a woman in the full
meanin&#8217; of the word,&#8221; Dad reflected, &#8220;but they&#8217;ve got
the marks on &#8217;em of what they&#8217;ll turn out to be. The
man that marries Mary he&#8217;ll play safe; the feller that
gits Joan takes on a gamble. If she ever does marry
Reid he&#8217;ll not keep her seven months. Shucks! I married
a red-headed woman one time back in Oklahomey,
and that blame woman run off with a horse-doctor inside
of three months. I never did hear tell of that fool
woman any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you on the way you&#8217;ve got Joan
sized up, no difference if your wife did run off with a
horse-doctor. Her hair ain&#8217;t red, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well be. You ain&#8217;t so much of a hand at
readin&#8217; people, anyhow, John; before you marry you
ought to see a fortune-teller and have your hand read.
You got away off on Reid, holdin&#8217; up for him agin&#8217; my
judgment when he first come here on the range&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to pass judgment on him in advance;
that was all, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course, you couldn&#8217;t be expected to know men and
women like us fellers that&#8217;s batted around among &#8217;em all
our lives, and you shut up with a houseful of kids
teachin&#8217; &#8217;em cipherin&#8217; and spellin&#8217;. I never did see a
schoolteacher in my life, man or woman, that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
couldn&#8217;t take on the blind side and beat out of their
teeth, not meanin&#8217; any disrespect to you or any of &#8217;em,
John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure not. I understand what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean you&#8217;re too trustful, too easy to take folks at
their word. You&#8217;re kids in your head-works, and you
always will be. I advise you strong, John, to have
somebody read your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before marrying Mary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-el-l, you <i>might</i> be safe in marryin&#8217; Mary. If
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had my hand read last spring before I come up
here to this range I bet I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; missed the trap I stumbled
into. I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been warned to look out for a dark
woman, like I was warned once before, and I bet you a
dime I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; <i>looked</i> out, too! Oh, well, it&#8217;s too late now.
I guess I was fated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s fated; we&#8217;re all branded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard it said, and I&#8217;m beginnin&#8217; to believe it.
Well, I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been any better off if I&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; got that widow-lady. Rabbit ain&#8217;t so bad. She can
take care of me when I git old, and maybe she&#8217;ll treat
me better&#8217;n a stranger would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have any doubt about it in the world. It
was a lucky day for you when Rabbit found you and
saved you from the Four Corners widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I expect that woman she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; worked me purty
hard&ndash;&ndash;she had a drivin&#8217; eye. But a feller&#8217;s got one
consolation in a case where his woman ribs him a little
too hard; the road&#8217;s always open for him to leave, and
a woman&#8217;s nearly always as glad to see a man go as he
is to git away.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t work both ways.
But fashions are changing, Dad; they go to the divorce
courts now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That costs too much, and it&#8217;s too slow. Walk out
and leave the door standin&#8217; open after you; that&#8217;s always
been my way. They keep a lookin&#8217; for you to
come back for a month or two; then they marry some
other man. Well, all of &#8217;em but Rabbit, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was the one that remembered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That woman sure is some on the remember, John.
Well, I ought &#8217;a&#8217; had my hand read. A man&#8217;s a fool
to start anything without havin&#8217; it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad nursed his regret in silence, his face dim in the
starlight. Mackenzie was off with his own thoughts;
they might have been miles apart instead of two yards,
the quiet of the sheeplands around them. Then Dad:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; of Mary, are you, John?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie laughed a little, like an embarrassed lover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got my eye on her,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No gamble about Mary,&#8221; Dad said, in deep earnestness.
&#8220;Give her a couple of years to fill out and widen
in and you&#8217;ll have a girl that&#8217;ll do any man&#8217;s eyes good
to see. I thought for a while you had some notions
about Joan, and I&#8217;m glad to see you&#8217;ve changed your
mind. Joan&#8217;s too sharp for a trustin&#8217; feller like you.
She&#8217;d run off with some wool-buyer before you&#8217;d been
married a year.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>ONE MAN&#8217;S JOKE</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie went across the hills next morning
to relieve Reid of his watch over the sheep, feeling
almost as simple as Dad and the rest of them believed
him to be. He was too easy, he had been too
easy all along. If he had beaten Hector Hall into a
blue lump that day he sent him home without his guns;
if he had pulled his weapon at Swan Carlson&#8217;s first appearance
when the giant Swede drove his flock around
the hill that day, and put a bullet between his eyes, Tim
Sullivan and the rest of them would have held him in
higher esteem.</p>
<p>Reid would have held him in greater respect for it,
also, and it might not have turned out so badly for
Joan. He wondered how Reid would receive him, and
whether they would part in no greater unfriendliness
than at present.</p>
<p>Reid was not with the sheep when Mackenzie arrived
where they fed. The flock was widely scattered, as if
the shepherd had been gone a long time, the dogs seemingly
indifferent to what befell, showing a spirit of insubordination
and laziness when Mackenzie set them
about their work. Mackenzie spent the morning getting
the flock together, noting its diminished numbers
with quickly calculating eye.</p>
<p>Reid must have been leaving the sheep pretty much
to themselves for the wolves to take that heavy toll.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
Strange that Sullivan had not noticed it and put a
trustworthy herder in charge. But Sullivan was more
than a little afraid to show himself for long on that part
of his lease, and perhaps had not taken the time to run
his eye over the sheep. It was a matter to be laid before
his attention at once. Mackenzie did not want
this loss charged against him as another example of his
unfitness to become a master over sheep on the profit-sharing
plan.</p>
<p>It was past noon when Reid returned, coming riding
from Swan Carlson&#8217;s range. He came only near enough
to Mackenzie to see who it was, galloping on to the
wagon. There he unsaddled his horse and turned it to
graze, setting about immediately to get his dinner.
Mackenzie waited for a summons when the meal was
ready, but received none. Presently he saw that Reid
had no intention of calling him in, for he was sitting
down selfishly alone.</p>
<p>Mackenzie determined there was not going to be any
avoidance on his part. If unpleasantness must rise
between them Reid would be the one to set it stewing,
and it looked from a distance as if this were his intention.
Mackenzie went to camp, his coat on his arm.</p>
<p>Reid had finished his dinner when Mackenzie arrived.
He was sitting in the shade of some low bushes, his hat
on the ground, smoking a cigarette. He looked up at
the sound of Mackenzie&#8217;s approach, smiling a little, waving
his cigarette in greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jacob,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt the hot blood rush to his face, but
choked down whatever hot words rose with it. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
could not suppress the indignation, the surprise, that
came with the derisive hail. It seemed that the range,
vast, silent, selfish, melancholy as it was, could not keep
a secret. What did Reid know about any Jacob and
Rachel romance? How had he learned of that?</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you makin&#8217; it, Earl?&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
pleasantly enough. And to himself: &#8220;He listened, the
scoundrel&ndash;&ndash;sneaked up on us and heard it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well enough,&#8221; said Reid, coughing huskily.</p>
<p>If well enough, a little more of it would do for him,
Mackenzie thought, noting with surprise the change
that had come over Reid since they last met. The improvement
that had begun in him during his first weeks
on the range had not continued. Opposed to it, a decline
appeared to have fastened upon him, making his
flaccid cheeks thinner, his weary eyes more tired, his
slight frame lighter by many pounds. Only his voice
was unchanged. That was hearty and quick, resonant
of enjoyment in life and a keenness in the pursuits of its
pleasures. Reid&#8217;s voice was his most valuable possession,
Mackenzie knew; it was the vehicle that had carried
him into the graces of many transitory friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Tim had sent some old taller-heel over to
let me off&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t know it was you,&#8221; said Reid, lying
with perfect ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taller-heel enough, I guess,&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
detached and inattentive as it seemed, his mind fixed on
dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to get out so soon from
what Dad told me. Been havin&#8217; some trouble with your
hand?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right now.&#8221; Mackenzie was making use of
it to shake the coffeepot, only to find that Reid had
drained it to the grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d recognized you, Jacob, I&#8217;d made a double allowance,&#8221;
Reid said, lifting the corner of his big, unfeeling
mouth in a twitching grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might cut out that Jacob stuff, wherever you
got it,&#8221; Mackenzie told him, not much interested in it,
apparently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you take a joke, Mackenzie?&#8221; Reid made the
inquiry in surprised voice, with a well-simulated inflection
of injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want it rubbed in, Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid grunted, expressive of derision and contempt,
smoking on in silence while Mackenzie threw himself together
a hasty meal. Frequently Reid coughed, always
cupping his hand before his mouth as if to conceal from
himself as well as others the portentous harshness of the
sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Sullivan send you over?&#8221; Reid inquired at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said for me to come when I was able, but he
didn&#8217;t set any time. I concluded I was all right, and
came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can go back; I don&#8217;t need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for Sullivan to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the dead, Mackenzie, I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s going
to be comfortable with me and you in camp together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The road&#8217;s open, Earl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it was open out of this damned country!&#8221;
Reid complained. In his voice Mackenzie read the rankling
discontent of his soul, wearing itself out there in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the freedom that to him was not free, chafing and
longing and fretting his heart away as though the distant
hills were the walls of a prison, the far horizon its
bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sullivan wants you over at the ranch,&#8221; Mackenzie
told him, moved to pitying kindness for him, although
he knew that it was wasted and undeserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather stay over here, I&#8217;d rather hear the coyotes
howl than that pack of Sullivan kids. That&#8217;s one-hell
of a family for a man to have to marry into, Mackenzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen men marry into worse,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>Reid got up in morose impatience, flinging away his
cigarette, went to the wagon, looked in, slammed the
little canvas door with its mica window shut with a bang,
and turned back.</p>
<p>There seemed little of the carelessness, the easy spirit
that had made him so adaptable at first to his surroundings,
which Reid had brought with him into the
sheeplands left in him now. He was sullen and downcast,
consumed by the gnawing desire to be away out of
his prison. Mackenzie studied him furtively as he compounded
his coffee and set it to boil on the little fire,
thinking that it required more fortitude, indeed, to live
out a sentence such as Reid faced in the open than
behind a lock. Here, the call to be away was always
before a man; the leagues of freedom stretched out
before his eyes. It required some holding in on a man&#8217;s
part to restrain his feet from taking the untrammeled
way to liberty under such conditions, more than he
would have believed Reid capable of, more than he expected
him to be equal to much longer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>Reid came slowly over to where he had left his hat,
took it up, and stood looking at it as if he had found
some strange plant or unusual flower, turning it and
regarding it from all sides. It was such strange behavior
that Mackenzie kept his eye on him, believing
that the solitude and discontent had strained his mind.</p>
<p>Presently Reid put the hat on his head, came over to
Mackenzie&#8217;s fire, and squatted near it on his heels,
although the sun was broiling hot and the flare of the
ardent little blaze was scorching to his face. So he
sat, silent as an Indian, looking with fixed eyes at the
fire, while Mackenzie fried his bacon and warmed a can
of succotash in the pan. When Mackenzie began to
eat, Reid drew back from the fire to make another
cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;But will it pay a man,&#8221; he said ruminatively, as if
turning again a subject long discussed with himself,
&#8220;to put in three years at this just to get out of work all
the rest of his life? That&#8217;s all it comes to, even if I
can keep the old man&#8217;s money from sifting through my
hands like dry sand on a windy day. The question is,
will it pay a man to take the chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid did not turn his eyes toward Mackenzie as he
argued thus with himself, nor bring his face about to
give his companion a full look into it. He sat staring
across the mighty temptation that lay spread, league
on league before him, his sharp countenance sharper
for the wasting it had borne since Mackenzie saw him
last, his chin up, his neck stretched as if he leaped the
barriers of his discontent and rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long shot, Mackenzie,&#8221; he said, turning as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
spoke, his face set in a cast of suffering that brought
again to Mackenzie a sweep of pity which he knew to
be a tribute undeserved. &#8220;I made a joke about selling
out to you once, Mackenzie; but it isn&#8217;t a thing a man
can joke about right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it was only a joke, Earl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it was a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid spoke with much of his old lightness, coming out
of his brooding like a man stepping into the sun. He
laughed, pulling his hat down on the bridge of his nose
in the peculiar way he had of wearing it. A little while
he sat; then stretched himself back at ease on his elbow,
drooling smoke through his nose in saturnine enjoyment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sullivan will double-cross you in the end, Jack; he&#8217;ll
not even give you Mary,&#8221; Reid said, speaking lazily,
neither derision nor banter in his way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; Mackenzie returned indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d double-cross me after I&#8217;d put in three years
runnin&#8217; his damned sheep if it wasn&#8217;t for the old man&#8217;s
money. Tim Sullivan would pick dimes off a red-hot
griddle in hell as long as the devil would stand by and
heat them. He&#8217;s usin&#8217; his girls for bait to draw greenhorns
and work their fool heads off on promises. A
man that would do that would sell his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie made no comment. He was through his
dinner and was filling his pipe, mixing some of Dad
Frazer&#8217;s highly recommended twist with his own mild
leaf to give it a kick.</p>
<p>&#8220;He played you into the game with Joan for a bait,
and then I got shipped out here and spoiled that,&#8221; said
Reid. &#8220;Now he&#8217;s stringin&#8217; you on for Mary. If you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
as wise a guy as I take you to be, Jack, you&#8217;ll cut this
dump and strike out in business for yourself. There&#8217;s
a feller over east of Carlson wants to sell out&ndash;&ndash;you can
get him on the run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t buy one side of a sheep,&#8221; Mackenzie replied,
wondering why this sudden streak of friendly
chatter.</p>
<p>Mackenzie ground Dad&#8217;s twist in his palm, poured a
charge of his pale mixture into it, ground them again
together under the heel of his fist, Reid looking on with
languid eyes, hat down on his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do with that roll you used to carry
around out here?&#8221; Reid inquired, watching the compounding
of the tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a mighty little one, Earl,&#8221; Mackenzie returned,
laughing pleasantly.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&#8217;s big enough for me&ndash;&ndash;hand it over!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Reid flipped his gun from the scabbard, his elbow
pressed close to his side as he reclined in the lazy, inoffensive
pose, holding the weapon down on Mackenzie
with a jerk which he must have practiced long to give
it the admirable finish and speed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>Mackenzie raised his eyes slowly from his task
of blending tobacco, looked for a moment into
Reid&#8217;s determined face, remembering with a falling heart
that he had taken his own revolver off and hung it in
the wagon when he came in, to relieve himself of the
weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry&ndash;&ndash;hand it out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid lifted himself slightly, elbow still pressed close
to his side, raising his face a foot nearer Mackenzie&#8217;s,
his eyes drawn small, the corners of his mouth twitching.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s hands were poised one above the other,
as he had suspended his milling operations. As quickly
as the hand of a prestidigitator flashes, Mackenzie swept
the one that held the tobacco, dashing the powdered
mixture into Reid&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Reid fired as he sprang to his feet, gasping and choking,
momentarily blinded by the fiery tobacco. Mackenzie
felt the bullet lift his hair as it passed his temple,
and before it was many rods on its way through the
canvas top of the wagon he had grappled with Reid and
wrenched his gun away.</p>
<p>Reid had no hands for a fight, even if it had been in
him to attempt it, being busy with his streaming eyes.
He cursed Mackenzie as he sputtered and swabbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it all, Mackenzie, can&#8217;t you take a joke?&#8221;
he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t get you&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re too funny for me,&#8221;
Mackenzie returned. &#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;wash your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie offered the water pail, Reid groping for
it like a blind man, more tears streaming down his face
than he had spent before in all his life together. He
got the rough of it out, cursing the while, protesting
it was only a joke. But Mackenzie had read human
eyes and human faces long enough to know a joke when
he saw it in them, and he had not seen even the shadow
of a jest in the twitching mask of Reid&#8217;s unfeeling countenance
as he leaned on his elbow holding his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right about it a little while ago,&#8221; Mackenzie
told Reid when he looked up with red, reproachful
eyes presently; &#8220;this range isn&#8217;t big enough for you
and me.&#8221; Mackenzie jerked his hand toward the saddle
and bridle which Reid had lately taken from his horse.
&#8220;Get to hell out of here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid went without protest, or word of any kind,
wearing his belt and empty scabbard. Mackenzie
watched him saddle and ride over the ridge, wondering
if he would make a streak of it to Sullivan and tell him
what a poor hand his school-teaching herder was at
taking a joke. Curious to see whether this was Reid&#8217;s
intention, Mackenzie followed him to the top of the hill.
Reid&#8217;s dust was all he could trace him by when he got
there, and that rose over toward Swan Carlson&#8217;s ranch,
whence he had come not more than an hour ago.</p>
<p>Pretty thick business between that precious pair,
Mackenzie thought, and of a sort not likely to turn out
of much profit to either them or anybody else. Carlson
was a plain human brute without any sense of honor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
or any obligation to the amenities of civilized society;
Reid was simply an unmoral sharper.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t make any difference where Reid went, or
what he planned; he would have to stay away from that
camp. That Mackenzie vowed, meaning it to the last
letter. Tim Sullivan would be informed of this latest
pleasantry at their first meeting, also, and hear a chapter
from Mackenzie&#8217;s heart on the matter of Joan.</p>
<p>Joan! If that leper Reid ever came near Joan, or
ever blew the pollution of a word to her, he would nail
him to the ground with a bullet, no matter that he was
in debt to him for his life.</p>
<p>Mackenzie found the rifle that Sullivan had provided
Reid for his defense under the bunk in the wagon, with
ammunition enough to withstand a siege. Reid evidently
had not been using the gun in practice very much,
confining his rehearsals to the quick slinging of his
pistol, rather, as the cunning of his hand in the attempted
robbery that afternoon seemed to prove. Not
wanting Reid to have any weapon to his hand in case
he came back, Mackenzie buckled on the revolvers, hid
the rifle near the wagon, and went back to guard the
sheep.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt himself softening in his judgment of
Reid as the day drew toward evening. He feared he had
been a little severe with him, taking his gun away and
sending him off, surly and vindictive. Perhaps it was
only a joke, as Reid had protested, although there had
been no glimmer of jest in his eyes when he had slung
out his gun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>Still, the boy was hardly responsible, oppressed by his
load of dissatisfaction, harrassed and disturbed by that
unbalancing ailment they called the lonesomeness. If
he had come at it right, Mackenzie reflected, he could
have had a hundred dollars or so, even though in staking
him to it he would have been helping a criminal to
escape.</p>
<p>He began to hope Reid would come back and try to
square it. If he wanted the money to leave the country
on then he could have it. Holding him there in the
sheep country would not work his reformation, but
would breed and store the virus of resentment, making
him a truly dangerous man to set free to prey upon
society when his term was done.</p>
<p>But Reid never would remain to finish his three years
of penance there. Joan had seen it, even before his
malady had fastened upon him so deeply. It might be
a merciful deed to finance his going, and speed him
toward the land of his desire. But how he would live
in Mexico would be another matter. Perhaps he would
work. At any event, he would be free.</p>
<p>Mackenzie had ranged his flock a considerable distance
from the wagon, keeping to the hilltops above
the sheep, according to the custom of herders. He was
sitting in a gully, his back against the bank, feeling a
weariness over him that he blamed mainly to the weight
of the revolvers and cartridge belt in his weakened state,
when he saw Reid coming back.</p>
<p>Reid broke over the hill beyond the sheep-wagon at
a gallop, hatless, riding low, and the sound of shots
behind him beat the tune to which he traveled. Mackenzie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
got to his feet, his weariness gone on the surge of
concern that thrilled him. Hector Hall had come to
collect his outstanding account at last.</p>
<p>And Reid was unarmed. Because of this he had been
forced to flee before his enemy like a coward, against his
nature, to his humiliation, Mackenzie knew. He should
not have allowed Reid to leave camp without his gun,
he would not have done it if he had reflected a moment
on the risk of going unarmed when there was one abroad
on the range who sought his life. If Reid should fall,
Mackenzie felt he would be an accessory to the crime.</p>
<p>Two men were pursuing Reid. They drew up a
moment on the hilltop, then came down the long slope
at reckless speed, not wasting any more ammunition at
that distance, which was not above two hundred yards,
but dividing to cut off Reid&#8217;s retreat, draw in on him
then, and make an end of it at close range.</p>
<p>Reid halted at the wagon, where he made a hasty
search for the rifle without dismounting, hidden for a
moment from his pursuers. He was too far away to
hear Mackenzie&#8217;s shouted directions for finding the gun.
On again toward Mackenzie he came, halting a little
way along to look back at the men who were maneuvering
to cut off any swerving or retreat that he might
attempt. Mackenzie beckoned him on, shouting, waving
his hat, running forward to his relief.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s thought was to give Reid his revolver,
split the ammunition with him, each of them take a
man, and fight it out. But Reid sat straight in the
saddle, looking back at the two who came pressing on,
seeming to fear them less than he hated the humiliation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
of seeking shelter under Mackenzie&#8217;s protection. Mackenzie
understood his feeling in the matter, and respected
Reid for it more than for anything he ever had
done.</p>
<p>While Mackenzie was yet a hundred yards from Reid
he saw him swing from the saddle and shelter himself
behind his horse. Hall and his companion were standing
off warily, a good pistol shot from Reid, distrustful
of this sudden change in his tactics, apparently believing
he had come to the place he had selected to make
his defensive stand. A little while they stood waiting
for him to fire, then separated, the stranger circling to
come behind Mackenzie, Hall moving a little nearer to
Reid, who kept his horse before him with the craft of
an Indian.</p>
<p>Hall stood a little while, as if waiting for Reid to
fire, then rode forward, throwing a stream of lead as he
came. Reid&#8217;s horse reared, ran a few rods with head
thrown wildly high, its master clinging to the bit, dragging
over shrub and stone. Suddenly it collapsed forward
on its knees, and stretched dead.</p>
<p>Reid flung himself to the ground behind the protection
of its carcass, Hall pausing in his assault to reload.
The man who had ridden a wide and cautious circuit to
get behind Mackenzie now dismounted and began firing
across his saddle. Mackenzie turned, a pistol in each
hand, indecisive a moment whether to return the fellow&#8217;s
fire or rush forward and join Reid behind the
breastworks of his beast.</p>
<p>The stranger was nearer Mackenzie by many rods
than Hall, but still so far away that his shots went wide,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
whistling high over Mackenzie&#8217;s head, or kicking dirt
among the shrubs at either hand. Hall was charging
down on Reid again, but with a wariness that held him
off a distance of comparative safety.</p>
<p>In the moment that he paused there, considering the
best and quickest move to make to lessen Reid&#8217;s peril,
the thought shot to Mackenzie like a rending of confusing
clouds that it was not so much Reid&#8217;s peril as
his own. These men had come to kill him; their sighting
Reid on the way was only an incident. It was his fight,
and not Reid&#8217;s, for Reid was safe behind his horse, lying
along its body close to the ground like a snake.</p>
<p>This understanding of the situation cleared the air
tremendously. Where he had seen in confusion, with a
sense of mingling and turning but a moment before,
Mackenzie now beheld things with the sharpness of
self-interest, calculating his situation with a comprehensive
appraisement of every yard that lay between
him and his enemies. He was steady as a tree, light with
a feeling of relief, of justification for his acts. It was
as if putting off the thought that he was going into
this fight for Earl Reid had taken bonds from his arms,
leaving him free to breathe joyously and strike with the
keenness of a man who has a wild glory in facing tremendous
odds.</p>
<p>All in a moment this clearing of brain and limb came
to him, setting him up as if he had passed under an icy
torrent and come out refreshed and clear-eyed into the
sun. He bent low behind a shrub and rushed down the
hillside toward the man who stood reloading his pistol,
his hat-crown showing above the saddle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>Reid was all right back there for a little while, he
knew; Hall would hold off a bit, not knowing what he
might meet by rushing in with precipitation. This one
first, then Hall. It was not Reid&#8217;s fight; it was his fight,
Reid but an incident in it, as a sheep might run between
the combatants and throw its simple life in peril.</p>
<p>The fellow behind the horse, too sure of his safety,
too contemptuous of this shepherd schoolmaster whose
notorious simplicity had gone abroad in the sheeplands
exciting the rough risibilities of men, was careless of
whether his target stood still or ran; he did not lift his
eyes from the reloading of his gun to see. And in those
few precious moments Mackenzie rushed down on him
like a wind from the mountain, opening fire with not
more than twenty yards between.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s first shot knocked leather from the saddle-horn.
The horse squatted, trembling, snorted its
alarm, trampled in panic, lifting a cloud of dust. And
into this rising dust Mackenzie sent his lead, not seeing
where it struck, quickly emptying one revolver, quickly
shifting weapons from hand to hand, no pause in his
hot assault.</p>
<p> The stranger cursed his frightened horse, both hands
busy with the beast to stay it from plunging away and
leaving him exposed to something he had not counted
on meeting. Mackenzie pushed on, firing at every step.
The horse partly turned, head toward him, partly baring
the scoundrel who was that moment flinging his leg over
the saddle to seek a coward&#8217;s safety. It was a black
mare that he rode, a white star in its forehead, and now
as it faced about Mackenzie, not thirty feet away, threw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
a bullet for the white spot between the creature&#8217;s eyes.
It reared, and fell, coming down while its rider&#8217;s leg
still lay across the saddle, his other foot held in the
stirrup.</p>
<p>A moment Mackenzie stood, the smoking pistol in
his hand, leaning forward like a man who listened into
the wind, his broad hat-brim blown back, the smoke of
his firing around him. The horse lay still, its rider
struggling with one leg pinned under it, the other across
the saddle, the spur of that foot tearing the dead creature&#8217;s
flesh in desperate effort to stir in it the life that
no cruelty could awaken.</p>
<p>Leaning so, the wind in his face, the smoke blowing
away behind him, Mackenzie loaded his revolvers. Then
he ran to the trapped invader of his peace and took
away his guns, leaving him imploring mercy and assistance,
the dead horse across his leg.</p>
<p>Mackenzie was aware of shooting behind him all this
time, but only as one is conscious of something detached
and immaterial to the thing he has in hand. Whether
Hector Hall was riding down on him in defense of his
friend, or whether he was trying to drive Reid from the
shelter of his fallen horse, Mackenzie did not know, but
from that moment Hall was his business, no matter
where he stood.</p>
<p>Putting out of the fight the man who lay pressed
beneath his horse had been a necessary preliminary, a
colorless detail, a smoothing away of a small annoyance
in the road of that hour&#8217;s great work. For the end was
justified beforehand between him and Hall. It was not
a matter of vengeance, but of justice. This man had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
once attempted to take away his life by the most diabolical
cruelty that human depravity could devise.</p>
<p>This passed through Mackenzie&#8217;s thoughts like the
heat of a fire that one runs by as he swung round to
face Hall. Apparently unconcerned by what had befallen
his friend, Hall was circling Reid&#8217;s dead horse, holding
tenaciously to his intention of clearing the ground
before him as he advanced. Reid snaked himself on his
elbows ahead of his enemy&#8217;s encircling movement, keeping
under cover with admirable coolness and craft.</p>
<p>Mackenzie ran forward, throwing up his hand in
command to Hall, challenging him as plainly as words
to turn his efforts from a defenseless man to one who
stood ready to give him battle. Hall drew off a little
from Reid&#8217;s concealment, distrustful of him even though
he must have known him to be unarmed, not caring to
put a man behind his back. Still drawing off in that
way, he stopped firing to slip more cartridges into his
automatic pistol, watching Mackenzie&#8217;s rapid advance,
throwing a quick eye now and then toward the place
where Reid lay out of his sight.</p>
<p>Hall waited in that sharp pose of watchful indecision
a moment, then spurred his horse with sudden bound
toward Reid. He leaped the carcass of Reid&#8217;s animal
at a gallop, firing at the man who huddled close against
its protection as he passed over. Mackenzie could not
see Reid from where he stood, but he felt that his peril
was very great, his chances almost hopeless in the face
of Hall&#8217;s determination to have revenge on his brother&#8217;s
slayer in defiance of what might come to himself when
the thing was done.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie ran a little nearer, and opened fire. Heedless
of him, Hall swung his horse back at a gallop, firing
at Reid as he advanced. Reid came rolling round the
carcass of his horse to place himself in the protection of
the other side, so nimble in his movements that Mackenzie
drew a breath of marveling relief. If Reid was
touched at all by Hall&#8217;s vicious rain of lead, it could be
only slightly.</p>
<p>Hall&#8217;s headlong charge carried him several rods beyond
Reid, the horse springing high over the barrier.
Again Reid escaped, again he came rolling back to shelter,
his body as close to the ground as a worm&#8217;s. When
Hall pulled up his sliding, stiff-legged horse and turned
in the cloud of dust to ride once more upon his defenseless
enemy, it was to face Mackenzie, who had run up
and posted himself directly in his way.</p>
<p>Reid&#8217;s dead horse lay not more than twenty feet
behind Mackenzie. Hector Hall leaned glowering at him
through the dust perhaps twice that distance ahead.
A moment Hall leaned in that way, then came spurring
on, holding his fire as if his purpose were to ride Mackenzie
down in contempt.</p>
<p>Mackenzie fired, steady against the onrushing charge
as a rock in the desert wind. He was thrilled by a calm
satisfaction in meeting this man who had contemned
and despised him, whose cold eyes spoke insults, whose
sneering lips were polluted with the blasphemies of his
filthy heart.</p>
<p>When Hall returned the fire he was so close that the
flame of his weapon struck hot against Mackenzie&#8217;s
face. Mackenzie leaped aside to avoid the horse, untouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
save by the spurting flame, emptying his pistol
into Hall&#8217;s body as he passed. A little way on Hall
wheeled the horse and came riding back, but the blindness
of death was in his face, his rapid shots fell wild
among the shrubs at Mackenzie&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>On past Mackenzie the horse galloped, Hall weaving
in the saddle, the reins hanging free, his hands trailing
at his sides. Mackenzie put his pistol in the scabbard
with slow and deliberate hand, feeling that the battle
was done, watching Hall as he rode blindly on.</p>
<p>A little way, and the horse, whether through some
wild caprice of its own, or some touch of its dying rider,
circled back, galloping down the long slope toward the
man who had come to help Hall adjust his differences
with these contemptible sheepmen. Hall&#8217;s hat fell off
as his head sank forward; he bent, grappling his horse&#8217;s
mane. So for a little way he rode, then slipped from
the saddle, one foot entangled in the stirrup.</p>
<p>The horse stopped suddenly, as if a weighted rein
had been dropped. Mackenzie ran down the hill to
disengage Hall&#8217;s foot. But his merciful haste was useless;
Hall was beyond the torture of dragging at a
stirrup.</p>
<p>Mackenzie released the foot with a sad gentleness,
composed the dusty body, drew the reins over the horse&#8217;s
head and left it standing beside its dead master. Hall&#8217;s
companion in the raid was still struggling under his
fallen horse, and from the vigor of his attempts to free
himself Mackenzie gathered that he was not much hurt.</p>
<p>A moment&#8217;s work set the scoundrel on his feet, where
he limped on a whole bone, whole enough to ride on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
many a rascally foray again. Mackenzie said nothing
to him, only indicated by a movement of the hand what
he was to do. Limping painfully, the fellow went to
Hall&#8217;s horse, lifted his friend&#8217;s body across the empty
saddle, mounted behind it with a struggle, and rode in
humiliation from the field, glad enough to be allowed
to go.</p>
<p>Reid was standing beside his dead horse, watching
the fellow ride away. So for a little he stood, as if he
debated some movement against the man who had sought
his life with such hot cruelty but a few minutes past,
not turning to see whether Mackenzie came or went.
Presently he took his coat from the saddle, slung it
over his shoulder, looked after the retreating man again,
as if debating whether to follow.</p>
<p>Mackenzie came up, Reid&#8217;s pistol in his hand. This
he offered, apology in his manner, but no words on his
lips. Reid took it, silent and unmoved, shoved it into
his scabbard, walked away.</p>
<p>From the manner of his going, Mackenzie knew he
was not hurt. It was a comfortable thought for Mackenzie
that his interference had at least saved Reid a
wound. Doubtless he had saved him more. In that
last charge, Hector Hall would have had his life.</p>
<p>A part of his tremendous obligation to Reid was paid,
and Reid understood it so. But the knowledge of it
seemed to gall him, so deeply, indeed, that it appeared
he rather would have died than have Mackenzie succeed
in his defense.</p>
<p>Reid stopped where Hector Hall&#8217;s hat had fallen. He
turned it with his foot, looking down at it, and presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
picked it up. He made as if he would put it on, but
did not, and passed on carrying it in his hand.</p>
<p>Mackenzie wondered what his plans might be, and
whether he ought to go after him and try to put their
differences out of the way. Reid did not stop at the
wagon. He continued on to the top of the hill, defiant
of the man who rode away with Hall&#8217;s body, his pistol
again on his thigh. There he stood looking this way
and that a little while, as a man looks who is undecided
of his road. Then he passed on. When Mackenzie
reached the spot where Reid had stood, he was no longer
in sight.</p>
<p>Mackenzie thought Reid might be going deliberately
to seek the battle from which he had been obliged so
lately to flee unarmed. Mackenzie waited on the eminence,
listening for the sounds of fight, ready to hasten
to Reid&#8217;s assistance if he should stand in need of it
again. So the last hour of the afternoon passed. Mackenzie
turned back to his flock at length, believing Reid
had gone on his way to the freedom he had weighed
against his inheritance only a few hours before.</p>
<p>It was just as well then as another day, Mackenzie
reflected, as he turned the sheep from their grazing.
Not that he had meant to drive Reid out of the country
when he told him to go, but it was just as well. Soon
or late it would have to come to a show-down between
them, and one would have been compelled to leave.</p>
<p>But how would Sullivan view this abrupt ending of
the half-million-dollar penance, and the loss of three
years&#8217; unpaid labor? Not kindly, certainly. It probably
would result in the collapse of all Mackenzie&#8217;s own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
calculations as well, and the blighting of his sheep-wealth
dreams.</p>
<p>And that day he had slain a man in defense of Earl
Reid&#8217;s life, as Reid had killed in defense of his.</p>
<p>From the first hour he set his feet on the trail to the
sheep country this culmination of his adventures had
been shaping. Little by little it had been building, the
aggression pressed upon him, his attitude all along one
of defense. Perhaps when trouble is heading for a man,
as this was inevitably directed, the best thing to do is
rush to meet it with a club in the hand.</p>
<p>That was the way it looked to John Mackenzie that
evening. Trouble will put things over on a man who
is bent to compromise, every time. Undoubtedly it
looked that way. But he had killed a man. It was a
heavy thing to carry on his soul.</p>
<p>This depressing shadow thickened over him as the
sun drew down to the hills, and he went working his
flock slowly to the night&#8217;s bedding-ground. The complaint
of the lambs, weary from following and frisking
the day through, was sadder to him than it ever had
fallen on his ears before. It seemed a lament for the
pollution of his hands in human blood, moving a regret
in his heart that was harder to bear than fear.</p>
<p>Mackenzie sat above the resting sheep as the shadows
drew toward him between the hills, a glow as of a distant
city where the sun went down an hour past. The
rifle was beside him, his pistol in his belt, for regret of
past violence would not make the next hour secure. If
trouble should lift its head in his path again, he vowed
he would kill it before it could dart and strike.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>No, it was not a joke that Reid had pulled on him
that afternoon. Reid had meant to rob him, urged on
to the deed by his preying discontent and racking desire
to be away. Reid was on his way out of the country
now, and if they caught him and took him before the
judge who had sentenced him to this unique penance, he
would have the plea that Mackenzie drove him out, and
that he fled to save his life.</p>
<p>That might be sufficient for the judge; certainly it
would be enough for Tim Sullivan. Sullivan would bring
him back, and Mackenzie would be sent to pick up the
trail of his fortunes in another place, with years of
waiting between him and Joan, perhaps.</p>
<p>So Mackenzie sat with his moody thoughts, depressed,
downhearted, regretting bitterly the necessity that had
risen for taking away a fellow-creature&#8217;s life. It bore
on him heavily now that the heat of his blood had subsided;
it stood before him an awful accusation. He
had killed a man! But a man who had forfeited his
right to live, a man who had attempted to take his life
in the past, who had come again that day to hunt him
like a coyote on the hills. The law would exculpate him;
men would speak loudly of his justification. But it
would stand against him in his own conscience all his
days. Simple for thinking of it that way, he knew;
simple as they held him to be in the sheep country, even
down to old Dad Frazer, simplest among men.</p>
<p>He had no desire in his mouth for supper, although
he set about preparing it, wanting it over before dark.
No need of a blaze or a glow of a coal to guide anybody
that might be prowling around to drop a bullet into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
him. That surly rascal who bore Hector Hall&#8217;s body
away might come back to do it, but the man who stood
first in his thoughts and caution was Earl Reid, out
there somewhere in the closing night with a gun on him
and an itch in his hand to use it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>A SUMMONS IN THE NIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Somebody was calling on the hill behind the sheep-wagon.
Mackenzie sat up, a chill in his bones, for he
had fallen asleep on watch beside the ashes of his supper
fire. He listened, the rack of sleep clearing from his
brain in a breath.</p>
<p>It was Dad Frazer, and the hour was past the turn of
night. Mackenzie answered, the sound of a horse under
way immediately following. Dad came riding down the
hill with loose shale running ahead of him, in such a
hurry that he took the sharp incline straight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; Mackenzie inquired, hurrying
out to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dad, panting from excitement
as if he had run the distance between the camps on foot.
&#8220;Mary come over on her horse a little while ago and
rousted me out. She said somebody just passed her
camp, and one of &#8217;em was Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan? What would she&ndash;&ndash;what does Mary&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said,&#8221; Dad told him, sliding to the
ground. &#8220;I said Joan wouldn&#8217;t be trapsin&#8217; around this
time of night with nobody, but if she did happen to be
she could take care of herself. But Mary said she
sounded like she was fussin&#8217; and she thought something
must be wrong, and for me to hop her horse and come
hell-for-leather and tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many&ndash;&ndash;which way were they going?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Two horses, Mary said, from the sound, but she
didn&#8217;t hear nobody&#8217;s voice but Joan&#8217;s. She got Charley
up, and they run out and hollered, but she didn&#8217;t hear
nothing more of Joan. The poor kid&#8217;s scared out of
her &#8217;leven senses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did they go&ndash;&ndash;did Mary say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Towards Swan Carlson&#8217;s ranch, she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie swung into the saddle and galloped off,
leaving Dad listening to the sound of his going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nutty, like the rest of &#8217;em,&#8221; said Dad.</p>
<p>Carlson&#8217;s house was not more than eight miles from
the range where Mackenzie was running his sheep. He
held his course in that direction as he rode break-neck
up hill and down. He had little belief that it could
have been Joan who passed Mary&#8217;s camp, yet he was
disturbed by an anxiety that made his throat dry, and
a fear that clung to him like garments wet in the rain.</p>
<p>Reid could not have anything to do with it in any
event, Joan or somebody else, for Reid was horseless
upon the range. But if Joan, he was at entire loss to
imagine upon what business she could be riding the
country that hour of the night. Joan had no fear of
either night or the range. She had cared for her sheep
through storm and dark, penetrating all the terrors
that night could present, and she knew the range too
well to be led astray. It must have been a voice that
Mary had heard in a dream.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt easier for these reflections, but did not
check his pace, holding on toward Carlson&#8217;s house in as
straight a line as he could draw. He recalled curiously,
with a prickling of renewed anxiety, that he always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
expected to be called to Carlson&#8217;s house for the last act
in the sheeplands tragedy. Why, he did not know.
Perhaps he had not expected it; maybe it was only a
psychological lightning-play of the moment, reflecting
an unformed emotion. That likely was the way of it, he
reasoned. Surely he never could have thought of being
called to Carlson&#8217;s ranch.</p>
<p>In that fever of contradiction he pushed on, knees
gripping his horse in the tensity of his desire to hasten,
thinking to hold the animal up from stumbling as an
anxious rider in the night will do. Now he believed it
could not have been Joan, and felt a momentary ease;
now he was convinced that Mary could not have mistaken
her sister&#8217;s voice, and the sweat of fear for her
burst on his forehead and streamed down into his eyes.</p>
<p>From the side that he approached Carlson&#8217;s house
his way lay through a valley at the end, bringing him up
a slight rise as he drew near the trees that stood thickly
about the place. Here he dismounted and went on,
leading his horse. A little way from the house he hitched
his animal among the trees, and went forward in caution,
wary of a dog that might be keeping watch beside the
door.</p>
<p>There was no moon. The soft glow of a few misty,
somnolent stars gave no light among the trees, no light
shone from the house. Mackenzie recalled the night he
had first approached that door and come suddenly
around the corner into the pale beam of Hertha Carlson&#8217;s
lantern. Now the kitchen door might be shut, and
there was no window on that side.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stopped to listen, his senses as keen as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
savage&#8217;s under his strain. One who has not approached
danger and uncertainty, listening and straining in the
night, cannot conceive the exquisite pitch to which
human nerves can be attuned. The body then becomes
a tower set with the filaments of wireless telegraphy,
each of the thousand nerves straining forth to catch the
faintest sound, the most shadowy disturbance. Even
premonitions become verities; indistinct propositions
tangible facts.</p>
<p>In that exalted pitch of nervous sensibility Mackenzie
stood listening, fifty feet or less from the kitchen
door. No sound, but a sharp scent of cigarette smoke
came blowing from the dark house. Mackenzie&#8217;s heart
seemed to gorge and stop. Earl Reid was there. Perhaps
Mary had not heard a voice in a dream.</p>
<p>At the closed door Mackenzie listened. For a little,
no sound; then a foot shifted on the floor. Almost
immediately someone began walking up and down the
room, pushing a chair aside as if to clear the way. Mackenzie
remembered the window high in the wall beside
the stove and went hastily around the house to it,
restraining himself from bursting precipitately into
something which might be no concern of his or warrant
his interference at all. It seemed so preposterous even
to suspect that Joan was there.</p>
<p>Reid was pacing up and down the room, a lantern
standing on the floor beside the chair from which he
had risen. The place had been readjusted since the ruin
that fell over it in Mackenzie&#8217;s fight with Swan; the
table stood again in the place where he had eaten his
supper on it, the broken leg but crudely mended.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>Reid seemed to be alone, from what of the interior
of the house Mackenzie could see, shifting to bring the
door of the inner room to view. It was closed; Joan
was not there.</p>
<p>Mackenzie watched Reid as he paced up and down
the kitchen floor. There was a nervousness over him,
as of a man who faced a great uncertainty. He walked
with bent head, now turning it sharply as he stood
listening, now going on again with hands twitching.
He threw down his cigarette and stamped it, went to
the kitchen door, opened it and stood listening.</p>
<p>A little while Reid stood at the door, head turned,
as if he harkened for the approach of somebody expected.
When he turned from the door he left it
open, rolled a cigarette, crossed to the door of the
inner room, where he stood as if he debated the question
of entering. A little while in that uncertain, hesitant
way; then he struck a match on the door and turned
again to his pacing and smoking.</p>
<p>Mackenzie almost decided to go to the open door and
speak to Reid, and learn whether he might be of assistance
to him in his evident stress. He was ready to forgive
much of what had passed between them, blaming it
to Reid&#8217;s chafing against the restraint that was whetting
him down to a bone.</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt now that he had not handled Reid in
the right way. Reid was not of the slow, calculative,
lead-balanced type of himself. He was a wolf of civilization,
to whom these wilds were more galling than the
bars of a prison. The judge who had agreed to this
sentence had read deeply in the opaque soul of the youth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>Prison would not have been much of a penance for
Reid. There he would have found intrigue, whispering,
plottings; a hundred shadowy diversions to keep his
perverted mind clear and sharp. Here he met only the
silence of nature, the sternest accuser of a guilty soul.
Reid could not bear the accusation of silence. Under
it his mind grew irritable with the inflammation of incipient
insanity. In a little while it would break. Even
now he was breaking; that was plain in his disordered
eyes.</p>
<p>Still Mackenzie hesitated to speak to him, watching
him as he went with increasing frequency to the open
door to listen. It was not his affair; Joan could not
be there. Even if she were there, she must have come
for a purpose good and justifiable, and of her own free
will. But she was not there, and Reid was waiting for
somebody to come. Swan Carlson or his wife, it must
be, and what business they had before them in this
unrighteous hour Mackenzie could not imagine. But
plainly it had nothing to do with Joan.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s thoughts reverted to the night he came
to that cabin among the trees, guided thither by the
plaintive melody of Hertha Carlson&#8217;s song. What a
fool he had been to linger on there that night waiting
to see Swan, in the mistaken kindness to the woman the
wild fellow had made his slave. If he had gone on that
night, leaving the still waters of trouble unstirred, he
would have walked in peace through his apprenticeship.
Surely his crowding of trouble at Swan Carlson&#8217;s door
that night was the beginning of it all.</p>
<p>There was that door closed now on the inner room;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
on that night it stood open, the long chain that bound
the Swede&#8217;s wife running through it from the staple
driven into the log. Mackenzie had not noticed the
thickness of the door&#8217;s planks that night, or the crudity
of its construction. The handiwork of Swan Carlson
was proclaimed from that door; it was rough and
strong, like himself, without finish, loosely joined. Its
planks were oak; great nails in them marked the Z of
its brace.</p>
<p>Then Mackenzie turned his eyes upon Reid again.
Reid went back to the inner door, pushed it, tried it
with his foot. It seemed to be fastened within. Perhaps
there was a reason for its strength; maybe Swan kept
his crude treasures locked there in that small stronghold
of logs while he roamed the range after his sheep. Reid
did not appear greatly interested in the door, or what
lay behind it. He turned from it almost at once, drew
his chair in front of it, sat down, his right hand toward
Mackenzie, the lantern light strong on the lower part
of his body, his face in shadow from the lantern&#8217;s top.
Mackenzie quickened with a new interest, a new speculation,
when he saw that Reid&#8217;s holster hung empty at
his belt.</p>
<p>At once Mackenzie decided to speak to Reid, certain
that he had been through some misadventure in which
he had suffered loss. He drew away from the window,
going around the front part of the house to come to
the kitchen door, thinking it might be wise to know
the way the land lay around those premises.</p>
<p>This part of the house was little larger than the shack
of boards that had been built to it. There was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
opening in its solid log walls, neither of window or door
save alone the door opening into the kitchen. The place
was a vault.</p>
<p>Somebody was approaching, riding rapidly up the
valley. There was more than one horse, Mackenzie
could well make out as he stood at the corner of the
house, listening. He saw Reid&#8217;s shadow fall in the light
that spread through the open door, and turned back to
keep his watch at the window.</p>
<p>It was not the moment to offer friendship or sympathy
to Reid. Something of Reid&#8217;s own brewing was
coming to a boil there, some business of his own was
drawing to a head in that lonely cabin among the whispering
trees.</p>
<p>Reid took up the lantern, stood a moment as if indecisive,
placed it on the stove. Not satisfied with the
way the light of it struck him there, apparently, he
removed it and stood it in a corner. Whoever was
coming, Reid did not want it known at a glance that his
scabbard was empty. Mackenzie pressed a little nearer
the window. When a man prepared for a meeting with
that caution, he would do to watch.</p>
<p>Reid went to the open door, where he stood like a
host to receive his guests. The riders were among the
trees; coming on more slowly. Now they stopped, and
Reid turned to light a fresh cigarette. The flash of the
match showed his face white, hat pulled down on his
brows, his thin, long gamester&#8217;s fingers cupped round
the blaze.</p>
<p>There fell a moment of silence, no sound of word, no
movement of horse or foot upon the ground. Insects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
among the trees were grinding their scythes for tomorrow&#8217;s
reaping, it seemed, whirring in loud, harsh chorus
such as one never heard out on the grazing lands.</p>
<p>Now the sound of footsteps approaching the door.
Reid came back into the room, where he stood drawing
a deep breath of smoke like a man drinking to store
against a coming thirst. He dropped the cigarette,
set his foot on it, crushed it to sparks on the floor.</p>
<p>Swan Carlson was in the door, the light dim on his
stern, handsome face. Behind him stood his woman, a
white wimple bound on her forehead like a nun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>SWAN CARLSON LAUGHS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;So, you are here?&#8221; said Swan, standing in the
door, looking about him as if he had entered an
unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you look for me?&#8221; Reid returned. He stood
between Carlson and the closed inner door, foot on a
rung of the chair in which he lately had sat, his attitude
careless, easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man never knows,&#8221; Carlson replied, coming into
the room.</p>
<p>Hertha Carlson lingered just outside the door, as if
repelled by the recollection of old sufferings there.
Swan reached out, grasped her wrist, drew her roughly
inside, pointed to a chair. The woman sat down, her
eyes distended in fright, her feet drawn close to the
chair as if to hide them from the galling chain that she
had dragged so many weary months across the floor of
her lonely prison.</p>
<p>Swan pulled a chair to the table and sat down, elbows
on the board, facing Reid, a question in his attitude,
his face, to which he at once gave words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the money?&#8221; Reid countered, putting out
his hand. &#8220;You threw me down after I delivered you
three hundred sheep&ndash;&ndash;you didn&#8217;t come across with a
cent&ndash;&ndash;on the plea that one thief couldn&#8217;t collect from
another. All right, Swan; we&#8217;ll forget the sheep deal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
but this is another matter. Put your money in my
hand; then we&#8217;ll talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she in there?&#8221; Swan pointed to the door behind
Reid, half rising from his chair.</p>
<p>Reid put his hand to his empty holster, his body
turned from Carlson to conceal his want of a weapon.
Carlson jerked his head in high disdain, resumed his
chair, his great hand spread on the table.</p>
<p>Mackenzie stepped back from the window, leveling his
pistol at Reid&#8217;s head. Joan was the subject of this
infamous barter.</p>
<p>A moment Mackenzie&#8217;s finger stiffened to send a bullet
into Reid&#8217;s brain, for he considered only that such
depravity was its own warrant of death. But Reid was
unarmed, and there was something in his attitude that
seemed to disclose that it was a bluff. Joan was not
there.</p>
<p>Joan was not there. She would not remain silent and
unresisting, shut in a room while a cold-blooded scoundrel
bargained to deliver her for a price like a ewe out
of his flock. Reid was playing to even the deceit Carlson
had put over on him in dealing for the stolen sheep.
It was a bluff. Joan was not there.</p>
<p>Mackenzie let down the weapon. It was not the
moment for interference; he would allow the evidence
to accumulate before passing sentence and executing it
with summary hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come across with the money before we go any further,&#8221;
said Reid, firm in his manner, defiantly confident
in his bearing. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get out of this country
before morning.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give five hundred dollars for her,&#8221; Swan
declared. &#8220;How do I know she&#8217;d stay with me? She
might run off tomorrow if I didn&#8217;t have a chain on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid said nothing. He backed a little nearer the door
as if he had it in mind to call the negotiations off. Swan
looked at him with chin thrust forward, neck extended.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t here&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; he charged.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; there&#8217;s a pair of us, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought my woman&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Swan stretched out his
hand to call attention to her where she cowered in her
chair&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;fixed up to meet you like a bride. Woman for
woman, I say; that&#8217;s enough for any man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your woman, Carlson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tried to steal her from me; you was lovin&#8217; her
over on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you care? You don&#8217;t want her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Swan agreed heartily; &#8220;if I did I&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; choked your neck over there that night. Woman for
woman, or no trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not our bargain, Carlson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid spoke sharply, but with a dry quaver in his
voice that betrayed the panic that was coming over him
on account of this threatened miscarriage of his plans.
Mackenzie was convinced by Reid&#8217;s manner that Swan
had read him right. Joan was not there.</p>
<p>The thought that Joan would accompany Reid in the
night to Swan Carlson&#8217;s house on any pretext he could
devise in his crafty mind was absurd. It was all a bluff,
Reid playing on Swan&#8217;s credulity to induce him to hand
over the money, when he would make a dash for the
door and ride away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie stood close to the window, pistol lifted,
thinking it all out between Reid&#8217;s last word and Carlson&#8217;s
next, for the mind can build a castle while the
heart is pausing between throbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;My woman for yours, that&#8217;s a fair trade,&#8221; said
Swan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put no money in a wild colt
that maybe I couldn&#8217;t break. Open the door and bring
her to me, and take my woman and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doin&#8217;,&#8221; said Reid, regaining his nonchalance,
or at any rate control of his shaking voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar, you ain&#8217;t got no woman here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in there, all right&ndash;&ndash;come across with the
money and take her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know you&#8217;ve got any right to make a
trade? Have you got the papers to show she&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all the papers you&#8217;ll ever need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no papers&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s as much mine as she
is yours. Open the door!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlson got up, towering above Reid in his great
height. He took off his hat and flung it on the table,
stood a little while bending forward in his peculiar loose
droop with arms swinging full length at his sides. Reid
backed away from him, standing with shoulders against
the door as if to deny him passage, hand thrown to his
empty holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no gun!&#8221; Swan said, triumphantly.
&#8220;I seen the minute I come in the door you didn&#8217;t have
no gun. I wouldn&#8217;t fight a feller like you&ndash;&ndash;you couldn&#8217;t
stand up to me like that other feller done here in this
house one night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan looked round the room, the memory of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
battle like a light upon his stony face. He stood in
silence, turning his head slowly, as if he found a pleasure
in the stages of the past battle as recalled to him
by the different locations in the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted me to kill that feller so he couldn&#8217;t take
your woman away from you, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Swan said,
contemptuously. &#8220;Over there that day me and you
made that joke on him runnin&#8217; my sheep over into his.
But he didn&#8217;t take that joke&ndash;&ndash;what? He stood up to
me and fought me like an old bear, and he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; whipped
me another time if it hadn&#8217;t been for them dogs helpin&#8217;
me. You bet your hat he would! Yes, and then you
come up, and you said to me: &#8216;Soak him another one!&#8217;
And I looked at you, with red in my eyes. &#8216;Soak him,
put him out for good this time!&#8217; you says. And I
looked at you another time, my eye as red as blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; I says, &#8216;damn your skin, I&#8217;ll not soak him when
he&#8217;s down, and you&#8217;ll not do it, and no man ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217;
to do it! He&#8217;s the only man on this range that can
stand up to me,&#8217; I told you, &#8216;and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to save him
to fight!&#8217; That&#8217;s what I said to you. Well, he&#8217;ll come
after me when I take his woman away from him&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll
come after me so hard he&#8217;ll make the ground shake like
a train&ndash;&ndash;and he&#8217;ll fight me for her, a fight that men will
remember! We&#8217;ll roar like the wind, him and me, when
we stand up and fight for his woman that I took away
from him this night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid drew away from him, seeming to contract upon
himself against the door, and whether Swan read it
Mackenzie could not tell, but he could see from the window
the sickness of fear spread over Reid&#8217;s pale face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no gun on you,&#8221; Swan mocked, taking
joy from that moment. &#8220;Hell! my old woman can lick
you, and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make her do it. Then I&#8217;ll take
that feller&#8217;s woman away from you and kick you to hell
out of here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan turned to Hertha, who had left her chair on
his first threatening move toward Reid. She had advanced
a little way into the room, a wild fury in her
face against the man who had bargained to bring another
woman between her and her fierce, harsh-handed
lord. Swan took her by the arm, his hand at her back
as if to give her courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on&ndash;&ndash;lick him&ndash;&ndash;choke him the way I showed you
how to choke a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Swan clapped his hands, stamping his foot sharply,
as he had clapped and stamped to urge on the dog
against Mackenzie that day they fought on the range.
And like a dog that has strained on a leash the woman
leaped, flinging herself upon Reid with a wild, high-shrilling
cry.</p>
<p>Reid tried to guard his face against her fury, attempted
to grapple her arms and hold her. She broke
away, clawing his face, screaming her maniacal cry. In
a moment they were a whirling tangle of arms, wild-flying
hair, swaying bodies bent in fierce attack and desperate
defense. The furious creature had Reid by the
throat in the grip Swan had taught her, strangling out
his life.</p>
<p>Reid clung to her wrists, struggling to tear her hands
from his throat, thrashing wildly about before the closed
door, his head striking it now as the woman flung him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
now his shoulders as she bent him to force him to the
floor.</p>
<p>Swan stood by, leaning forward in a pose of deep
interest, deep satisfaction, savage enjoyment, his loose-hanging
arms at his sides, his long mustaches down
beside his mouth. He said nothing to encourage his
woman in her mad combat, only seemed waiting the
issue, ready to lay his hand to finishing it in the event
that she should fail.</p>
<p>The fighting woman, still screaming above the din
of their trampling feet, struggled to lift her knee to
Reid&#8217;s chest. Mackenzie turned from the window to
interfere, not caring to see Reid go that way, no matter
what sins lay upon his young soul. As he came
running to the door, he saw Reid struggle to his feet,
tear the mad woman&#8217;s hands away, and strike her a
sharp blow in the face.</p>
<p>There must have been surprising power in that slender
arm, or else its strength was multiplied by the frenzy
of the strangling man, for the woman dropped as if she
had been struck with an ax. Swan Carlson, standing
there like a great oaf, opened his immense mouth and
laughed.</p>
<p>Reid staggered against the wall, hands at his throat,
blood streaming from his nostrils, bubbling from his
lips as he breathed with wide-gasping mouth. He stood
so a little while, then collapsed with sudden failing, no
strength in him to ease the fall.</p>
<p>Carlson turned to face Mackenzie, his icy mirth spent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, by God, it&#8217;s a man,
anyhow!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>Carlson offered his hand as if in friendship. Mackenzie
backed away, watchful of him, hand to his pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s in that room, Carlson?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe nobody,&#8221; Swan replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll fight to see
who opens the door&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an eager gleam in Carlson&#8217;s face as he
made this proposal, standing between Mackenzie and
the closed door, his arm stretched out as if to bar the
schoolmaster&#8217;s nearer approach. He bent toward Mackenzie,
no hostility in his manner or expression, but
rather more like a man who had made a friendly suggestion,
the answer to which he waited in pleasurable
anticipation.</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked at him coldly, measuring his great
strength, weighing his magnificent body down to the
last unit of its power. Carlson&#8217;s shirt was open at his
throat, his laced boots came to his knees over his baggy
corduroy trousers, his long red hair hung over his
temples and ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s been fighting enough,&#8221; Mackenzie said,
thinking that Joan must be bound and gagged if in that
room. Surely she would have spoken otherwise at the
sound of his voice.</p>
<p>Hertha Carlson rose to her hands and knees, where
she remained a spell like a creeping child, almost at
Mackenzie&#8217;s feet. Reid lay where he had sunk down,
pitched forward in front of the closed door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll open it, then,&#8221; said Swan in the same glowing
eagerness. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a game&ndash;&ndash;whatever I find I&#8217;ll keep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch it!&#8221; Mackenzie warned, drawing a little
nearer, his weapon half out of the scabbard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Carlson rose between them, tall, disheveled, dress
torn open at her bosom. She seemed dazed and oblivious
to what was passing, stood a moment, hands pressed to
her face as one racked by an agony of pain, went to
the door, and out. Carlson stood staring after her a
breath, his bold chin lifted high, a look of surprise passing
like a light over his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I find will be mine,&#8221; Carlson said, almost happily.
&#8220;Come on&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll fight like a couple of men!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlson thrust his hand into the bosom of his shirt
as he spoke, and drew out a revolver with a long sweep
of his mighty arm, throwing his body with the movement
as if he rocked with a wild, mad joy. Mackenzie
fired as Carlson lifted the weapon to throw it down for
a shot. Carlson&#8217;s pistol fell from his shattered hand.</p>
<p>Swan stood a moment, that flickering light of surprise
flashing in his eyes again. Then he threw back his head
and shouted in the mad joy of his wild heart, his great
mouth stretched wide, his great mustaches moving in
his breath. Shouting still, as his Viking forebears
shouted in the joy of battle, the roar of his great voice
going far into the night, Swan rushed upon Mackenzie
like a wounded bear.</p>
<p>Mackenzie gave back before him, leaping aside, firing.
Checked a moment, more by the flash of the discharge
in his eyes than by the bullet, it seemed, Swan roared
a wilder note and pressed the charge. His immense,
lunging body was dim before Mackenzie through the
smoke, his uninjured hand groping like a man feeling
for a door in a burning house.</p>
<p>Swan fell with the mad challenge on his tongue, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
cried his defiance still as he writhed a moment on his
back, turning his face to the open door and the peace
of the night at last, to die. To die in greater heroism
than he had lived, and to lie there in his might and
wasted magnificence of body, one hand over the threshold
dabbling in the dark.</p>
<p>Mackenzie took the lantern from the corner where
Reid had set it in his studious play for the advantage
that did not come to his hand, and turned back to the
closed door. Reid lay as he had fallen, Carlson&#8217;s revolver
by his side. Mackenzie stepped over him and tried
the door. It was unlocked, fastened only by the iron
thumb-latch.</p>
<p>A moment Mackenzie stood, lifting the lantern to
light the small room to its corners, then went in, peering
and exploring into every shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great God! She wasn&#8217;t here at all! And I&#8217;ve
killed a man for that!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He turned to the open door, stifled by remorse for
what he had done, although he had done it in a fight
that had been pushed upon him, as all his fights in the
sheeplands had been pushed. He might have taken
Swan at his manly offer to fight hand-to-hand to see
who should open the door; or he might have allowed
him to open it, and saved all violence between them.</p>
<p>And this was the end of Earl Reid&#8217;s bluff to Carlson
that he would deliver Joan to him there, bargained for
and sold after the wild and lawless reasoning of the
Norse flockmaster. And Swan had drawn his weapon
with a glad light in his face, and stood up to him like
a man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Throw it down here, Mackenzie&ndash;&ndash;you can&#8217;t get by
with it this time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked up from his daze of remorseful
panic, slowly, amazedly, not fully realizing that it was
a human voice he heard, to see Reid where he had scrambled
to his knees, Carlson&#8217;s gun in one hand, the other
thrown out to support his unsteady body.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have it, Earl,&#8221; Mackenzie said, with the
relief in his voice of a man who has heard good tidings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; said Reid, in voice strained and dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gun&#8217;s empty; you can have it too. I&#8217;m
through,&#8221; Mackenzie said.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Mackenzie jerked the lantern sharply,
putting it out. Reid fired. Mackenzie felt the shot
strike his thigh like the flip of a switch when one rides
through a thicket. He threw himself upon Reid, and
held his arm while the desperate youth fired his remaining
shots into the wall.</p>
<p>Mackenzie shook Reid until he dropped the empty
revolver, then took him by the neck and pushed him to
the open door. And there the morning was spreading,
showing the trees outlined against the east.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out here and we&#8217;ll talk it over, Reid.&#8221; Mackenzie
said.</p>
<p>Reid had nothing to say. He was sullen, uncontrite.
Mackenzie waited a little while for him to speak, holding
him harshly by the collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s the road out of this country,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, seeing he would not speak. &#8220;This is the last
trick you&#8217;ll ever try to throw here on me or anybody
else. I suppose you came here on one of Carlson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
horses; go and get it, and when you start, head south.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie felt the leg of his trousers wet from the
blood of his wound, and began to have some concern lest
an artery had been cut. But this he put off investigating
until he heard Reid ride out to the dim road in front
of Carlson&#8217;s cabin, and go his way out of the sheeplands
to whatever destiny lay ahead.</p>
<p>Then Mackenzie looked himself over, to find that it
was not a serious wound. He bound up the hurt with
his handkerchief, and turned his face away from that
tragic spot among the cottonwoods, their leaves moving
with a murmur as of falling rain in the cool morning
wind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>SHEEPMAN&ndash;&ndash;AND MORE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;So I just took his gun away from him and slapped
him and sent him on,&#8221; said Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that must have been the way of it,&#8221; Mackenzie
said, sighing as if his last trouble had left him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he tried to make me believe I wasn&#8217;t within
seven miles of Dad Frazer&#8217;s camp I got my suspicions
up. The idea of that little town rat trying to mix me
up on my range! Well, I was a little off on my estimate
of where the wagons were, but that was because they&#8217;d
been moved so many times while I was over home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured it that way, Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you suppose he was tryin&#8217; to pull off
on me, John, bringing me out here on the pretense
you&#8217;d been all shot up in the fight with Hector Hall
and wanted me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Joan,&#8221; Mackenzie said, lying like the
&#8220;kind of a gentleman&#8221; he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought maybe the little fool wanted to make me
marry him so he could get some money out of dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that was it, Joan; I pass it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad Frazer says Earl was crazy from the lonesomeness
and killing Matt Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he must have been, Joan. It&#8217;s over&ndash;&ndash;let&#8217;s
forget it if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you haven&#8217;t done a thing but fight since you
struck this range,&#8221; Joan sighed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>Mackenzie was lying up in Rabbit&#8217;s hospital again,
undergoing treatment for the bullet wound in his thigh.
He had arrived at Dad Frazer&#8217;s camp at sunrise, weak
from the drain of his hurt, to find Joan waiting for him
on the rise of the hill. She hurried him into Rabbit&#8217;s
hands, leaving explanations until later. They had come
to the end of them now.</p>
<p>But Mackenzie made the reservation of Reid&#8217;s atrocious,
insane scheme in bringing Joan from home on the
pretext that the schoolmaster had fallen wounded to
death in the fight with Hector Hall, and lay calling for
her with his wasting breath. Mackenzie knew that it was
better for her faith in mankind for all her future years,
and for the peace of her soul, that she should never
know.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad was here a little while ago&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s gone over
to put a man in to take care of your sheep, but he&#8217;ll
be along back here this evening. He wants to talk some
business with you, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re ready for him, Joan,&#8221; Mackenzie said.
And the look that passed between them, and the smile
that lighted their lips, told that their business had been
talked and disposed of already, let Tim Sullivan propose
what he might.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to you, John,&#8221; said Joan, blushing a
little, her eyes downcast in modesty, but smiling and
smiling like a growing summer day.</p>
<p>Tim Sullivan arrived toward evening, entering the
sheep-wagon softly, his loud tongue low in awe for this
fighting man.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, John? How are you, lad?&#8221; he whispered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
coming on his toes to the cot, his face as expressive
of respect as if he had come into the presence of
the dead.</p>
<p>Mackenzie grinned over this great mark of respect
in the flockmaster of Poison Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tim sat on an upended box, leaning forward, hat
between his knees, mouth open a bit, looking at Mackenzie
as if he had come face to face with a miracle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not hurted much, lad?&#8221; he inquired, lifting
his voice a little, the wonder of it gradually passing
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. I&#8217;ll be around again in nine or ten days,
Rabbit says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will,&#8221; said Tim, eloquently decisive, as though
his heart emptied itself of a great responsibility, &#8220;you
will that, and as good as a new man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s better than any doctor I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is that!&#8221; said Tim, &#8220;and cheaper, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice grew a little louder, coming thus to familiar
ground in the discussion of values and costs. But the
awe of this man who went fighting his way was still big
in the flockmaster&#8217;s eyes. He sat leaning, elbows on
thighs, mouth still open, as respectfully awed as if he
had just come out of a church. Then, after a little
while, looking around for Joan:</p>
<p>&#8220;What was he up to, John? What was he tryin&#8217; to
do with my girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie told him, in few words and plain, pledging
him to keep the truth of it from Joan all his days.
Tim&#8217;s face grew pale through the deep brown of sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
and wind. He put his hand to his throat, unbuttoning
his collar with trembling fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she was too smart for him!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
brought her up a match for any of them town fellers&ndash;&ndash;they
can&#8217;t put anything like that over on my little Joan.
And you didn&#8217;t know but she was there, locked in and
bound hand and foot, lad? And you fought old Swan
and laid him cold at last, hand to hand, man to man!
Lord! And you done it for my little Joan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s forget it,&#8221; Mackenzie said, uncomfortable
under the praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy said, lad, but not so easy done. A man
remembers a thing the like of that with gratitude to his
last hour. And we thought you an easy-goin&#8217; man, that
could be put on and wasn&#8217;t able to hold your own,&#8221; said
Tim, confessing more in his momentary softness than
he would have done on reflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought you was only a schoolteacher, wrapped
up in rhymes and birds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a plain simpleton that would eat out of anybody&#8217;s
hand,&#8221; Mackenzie grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a simpleton, lad; not a simpleton. But maybe
soft in your ways of dealin&#8217; with other men, lettin&#8217; &#8217;em
go when you ought to knocked &#8217;em cold, the way you
let Hall go the day you took his guns off of him. But
we couldn&#8217;t see deep in you, lad; you&#8217;re no simpleton,
lad&ndash;&ndash;no simpleton at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim spoke in soothing conciliation, as if he worked
to salve over the old hurts of injustice, or as if he dealt
with the mishap of a child to whom words were more
comforting than balm. He was coming back to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
regular sheepman form, crafty, conciliatory; never advancing
one foot without feeling ahead with the other.
But the new respect that had come over him for Mackenzie
could not be put wholly aside, even though Tim
might have the disposition to do it. Tim&#8217;s voice was
still small in his mouth, his manner softened by awe.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve shown the mettle of a sheepman,&#8221; Tim said,
&#8220;and more. There&#8217;ll be peace and quiet on this range
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought nothing but trouble to it. You had peace
and quiet before I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble was here, lad, but we dodged it. There
wasn&#8217;t a man of us had the courage to face it and put
it down like you&#8217;ve done it. Carlson and them Halls
robbed me year in and year out, and stole the range I
paid rent on from under my feet. Swan stole sheep from
me all the time that boy was runnin&#8217; them next him
there&ndash;&ndash;I miss about three hundred from the flock
today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid sold them to him, but didn&#8217;t get his money. He
complained about it to Swan last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do it,&#8221; nodded Tim; &#8220;his father before him
done it. It runs in the blood of them Reids to steal.
I&#8217;ll have them three hundred sheep back out of Swan&#8217;s
widow tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she over there with the sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see her around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor creature&#8217;s crazy from her hard usage and
suffering. I think somebody ought to go over there and
help her straighten things out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to it,&#8221; Tim promised. &#8220;Yes, it must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
done. Now that wild devil&#8217;s dead we must be neighborly
with the widow and give her a chance. I&#8217;ll see to it
tomorrow. Where&#8217;s my Joan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s making some broth for my supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;ll care for you, lad;
I&#8217;ll leave her here with Rabbit to care for you. Sure.
She was for you, all along. I couldn&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got it right this time,&#8221; Mackenzie
said.</p>
<p>Tim beamed. He rubbed his hands, great satisfaction
in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find somebody else for my Mary&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll consider
her no more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let you go on with Joan in
the bargain in place of Mary, and give me three years
for her, and the day you marry her I&#8217;ll drive over to
you a thousand sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; said Mackenzie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years, we&#8217;ll say&ndash;&ndash;two instead of three, John.
Joan will be her own man in two years; she&#8217;ll be twenty-one.
And the day you marry her I&#8217;ll make it fifteen
hundred sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s her own man now under the laws of this state,
and I&#8217;m taking her without a single head of sheep. You
can keep them all&ndash;&ndash;Joan is enough for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim was a greatly injured man. His face lengthened
two inches, a look of reproach came into his eyes; he
seemed on the point of dissolving in tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not goin&#8217; to quit me and take away my girl,
the best one of my flock, my ewe lamb, my Joan? I
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d turn on me like that, lad; I didn&#8217;t
think you had it in your heart!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You took away Joan&#8217;s ewe lambs, and her buck
lambs, and all her lambs, more than a thousand of them,
after she&#8217;d served you through sun and storm and
earned them like a man. No, I don&#8217;t think I could trust
you two years, Mr. Sullivan; I don&#8217;t believe your memory
would hold you to a bargain that long, seeing that
it would be in the family, especially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give Joan back her flock, to run it like she was
runnin&#8217; it, and I&#8217;ll put it in writin&#8217; with you both. Two
years, we&#8217;ll say, John&ndash;&ndash;two short easy years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you throw away your chances now, John,
don&#8217;t you do it, lad. If you marry my Joan now I&#8217;ll
give you not a sheep, not one blind wether! But if
you&#8217;ll stay by me a year for her I&#8217;ll give you a weddin&#8217;
at the end of that time they&#8217;ll put big in the papers at
Cheyenne, and I&#8217;ll hand over to you three thousand
sheep, in your own name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking as much about sheep as I was three
months ago,&#8221; said Mackenzie, yawning as though he had
grown tired of the subject. &#8220;Joan and I have made
our plans; you can approve them or turn them down.
We&#8217;re going away when we&#8217;re married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; away!&#8221; said Tim, his voice betraying the hollowness
of his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re coming back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217; back?&#8221; said Tim, gladness in every note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joan&#8217;s heart is in the sheep range&ndash;&ndash;she couldn&#8217;t
tear it away if she tried. She thought she wanted to
go, but I&#8217;ll have hard work to get her farther than
Jasper. Joan had the lonesomeness; she&#8217;s cured now.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She had, poor gerrel! I didn&#8217;t see it, but I see it
now. But you&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Joan and I belong on the sheep range&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;re
both too simple and confiding to run around loose in
the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim was looking at Mackenzie, his head tipped to one
side a little in his great, new interest, his greater, newer
understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back and make it home?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; Mackenzie nodded. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other place
that calls. You can welcome us or turn us away, but
we&#8217;ll find a place on the range, and I&#8217;ve got money
enough to buy us a little band of sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need, lad, no need for that. What I have I&#8217;ll
divide with you the day you come home, for I&#8217;ve made
a place in my heart for you that&#8217;s the place of a son,&#8221;
said Tim.</p>
<p>Mackenzie knew the flockmaster had reached a point
at last where he would stand, writing or no writing, for
there was the earnestness of truth in his voice, the
vibrant softness of affection. He gave the flockmaster
his hand, saying no word. Tim took it between his own
as if he held a woman&#8217;s, and held it so while he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;And the place is here for you when you come back
be it a year from now or five years. You&#8217;re a sheepman
now, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m more,&#8221; said Mackenzie, with a contented
sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m a sheepwoman&#8217;s man.&#8221;</p>
